      "Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only astronomical object known to harbor life. About 29% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and islands. The remaining 71% is covered with water, mostly by oceans but also lakes, rivers and other fresh water, which together constitute the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of years. Earth's interior remains active with a solid iron inner core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field, and a convecting mantle that drives plate tectonics.\n",
      "According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence, Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Within the first billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms. Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties and geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass extinctions. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct. Almost 8 billion humans live on Earth and depend on its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans increasingly impact Earth's hydrology, atmospheric processes and other life.\n",
      "Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. Tropical regions receive more energy from the Sun than polar regions, which is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation. Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the surface temperature. A region's climate is not only determined by latitude, but also by its proximity to moderating oceans and height among other factors. Extreme weather, such as tropical cyclones and heat waves, occurs in most areas and has a large impact on life.\n",
      "Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially the Sun and the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite. Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane, producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and most massive of the four rocky planets.\n",

      "The modern English word  Earth developed, via Middle English, from an Old English noun most often spelled eorðe. It has cognates in every Germanic language, and their ancestral root has been reconstructed as *erþō. In its earliest attestation, the word eorðe was already being used to translate the many senses of Latin terra and Greek γῆ gē: the ground, its soil, dry land, the human world, the surface of the world (including the sea), and the globe itself. As with Roman Terra/Tellūs and Greek Gaia, Earth may have been a personified goddess in Germanic paganism: late Norse mythology included Jörð ('Earth'), a giantess often given as the mother of Thor.Historically, earth has been written in lowercase. From early Middle English, its definite sense as \"the globe\" was expressed as the earth. By Early Modern English, many nouns were capitalized, and the earth was also written the Earth, particularly when referenced along with other heavenly bodies. More recently, the name is sometimes simply given as Earth, by analogy with the names of the other planets, though earth and forms with the remain common. House styles now vary: Oxford spelling recognizes the lowercase form as the most common, with the capitalized form an acceptable variant. Another convention capitalizes \"Earth\" when appearing as a name (e.g. \"Earth's atmosphere\") but writes it in lowercase when preceded by the (e.g. \"the atmosphere of the earth\"). It almost always appears in lowercase in colloquial expressions such as \"what on earth are you doing?\"Occasionally, the name Terra  is used in scientific writing and especially in science fiction to distinguish humanity's inhabited planet from others, while in poetry Tellus  has been used to denote personification of the Earth. The Greek poetic name Gaea (Gæa)  is rare, though the alternative spelling Gaia has become common due to the Gaia hypothesis, in which case its pronunciation is  rather than the more Classical .There are a number of adjectives for the planet Earth. From Earth itself comes earthly. From the Latin Terra comes Terran , Terrestrial , and (via French) Terrene , and from the Latin Tellus comes Tellurian  and Telluric.\n",

      "The oldest material found in the Solar System is dated to 4.5682+0.0002−0.0004 Ga (billion years) ago. By 4.54±0.04 Ga the primordial Earth had formed. The bodies in the Solar System formed and evolved with the Sun. In theory, a solar nebula partitions a volume out of a molecular cloud by gravitational collapse, which begins to spin and flatten into a circumstellar disk, and then the planets grow out of that disk with the Sun. A nebula contains gas, ice grains, and dust (including primordial nuclides). According to nebular theory, planetesimals formed by accretion, with the primordial Earth being estimated as likely taking anywhere from 70–100 million years to form.Estimates of the age of the Moon range from 4.5 Ga to significantly younger. A leading hypothesis is that it was formed by accretion from material loosed from Earth after a Mars-sized object with about 10% of Earth's mass, named Theia, collided with Earth. It hit Earth with a glancing blow and some of its mass merged with Earth. Between approximately 4.1 and 3.8 Ga, numerous asteroid impacts during the Late Heavy Bombardment caused significant changes to the greater surface environment of the Moon and, by inference, to that of Earth.\n",

      "Earth's atmosphere and oceans were formed by volcanic activity and outgassing. Water vapor from these sources condensed into the oceans, augmented by water and ice from asteroids, protoplanets, and comets. Sufficient water to fill the oceans may have always been on the Earth since the beginning of the planet's formation. In this model, atmospheric greenhouse gases kept the oceans from freezing when the newly forming Sun had only 70% of its current luminosity. By 3.5 Ga, Earth's magnetic field was established, which helped prevent the atmosphere from being stripped away by the solar wind.As the molten outer layer of Earth cooled it formed the first solid crust, which is thought to have been mafic in composition. The first continental crust, which was more felsic in composition, formed by the partial melting of this mafic crust. The presence of grains of the mineral zircon of Hadean age in Eoarchean sedimentary rocks suggests that at least some felsic crust existed as early as 4.4 Ga, only 140 Ma after Earth's formation. There are two main models of how this initial small volume of continental crust evolved to reach its current abundance: (1) a relatively steady growth up to the present day, which is supported by the radiometric dating of continental crust globally and (2) an initial rapid growth in the volume of continental crust during the Archean, forming the bulk of the continental crust that now exists, which is supported by isotopic evidence from hafnium in zircons and neodymium in sedimentary rocks. The two models and the data that support them can be reconciled by large-scale recycling of the continental crust, particularly during the early stages of Earth's history.New continental crust forms as a result of plate tectonics, a process ultimately driven by the continuous loss of heat from Earth's interior. Over the period of hundreds of millions of years, tectonic forces have caused areas of continental crust to group together to form supercontinents that have subsequently broken apart. At approximately 750 Ma, one of the earliest known supercontinents, Rodinia, began to break apart. The continents later recombined to form Pannotia at 600–540 Ma, then finally Pangaea, which also began to break apart at 180 Ma.The most recent pattern of ice ages began about 40 Ma, and then intensified during the Pleistocene about 3 Ma. High- and middle-latitude regions have since undergone repeated cycles of glaciation and thaw, repeating about every 21,000, 41,000 and 100,000 years. The Last Glacial Period, colloquially called the \"last ice age\", covered large parts of the continents, up to the middle latitudes, in ice and ended about 11,700 years ago.\n",

      "=== Origin of life and evolution ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Chemical reactions led to the first self-replicating molecules about four billion years ago. A half billion years later, the last common ancestor of all current life arose. The evolution of photosynthesis allowed the Sun's energy to be harvested directly by life forms. The resultant molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in the atmosphere and due to interaction with ultraviolet solar radiation, formed a protective ozone layer (O3) in the upper atmosphere. The incorporation of smaller cells within larger ones resulted in the development of complex cells called eukaryotes. True multicellular organisms formed as cells within colonies became increasingly specialized. Aided by the absorption of harmful ultraviolet radiation by the ozone layer, life colonized Earth's surface. Among the earliest fossil evidence for life is microbial mat fossils found in 3.48 billion-year-old sandstone in Western Australia, biogenic graphite found in 3.7 billion-year-old metasedimentary rocks in Western Greenland, and remains of biotic material found in 4.1 billion-year-old rocks in Western Australia. The earliest direct evidence of life on Earth is contained in 3.45 billion-year-old Australian rocks showing fossils of microorganisms.During the Neoproterozoic, 1000 to 541 Ma, much of Earth might have been covered in ice. This hypothesis has been termed \"Snowball Earth\", and it is of particular interest because it preceded the Cambrian explosion, when multicellular life forms significantly increased in complexity. Following the Cambrian explosion, 535 Ma, there have been at least five major mass extinctions and many minor ones. Apart from the proposed current Holocene extinction event, the most recent was 66 Ma, when an asteroid impact triggered the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs and other large reptiles, but largely spared small animals such as insects, mammals, lizards and birds. Mammalian life has diversified over the past 66 Mys, and several million years ago an African ape gained the ability to stand upright. This facilitated tool use and encouraged communication that provided the nutrition and stimulation needed for a larger brain, which led to the evolution of humans. The development of agriculture, and then civilization, led to humans having an influence on Earth and the nature and quantity of other life forms that continues to this day. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth are extinct.\n",

      "=== Future ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Because carbon dioxide (CO2) has a long life time in the atmosphere, moderate human CO2 emissions may postpone the next glacial inception by 100,000 years. Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%. Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants (10 ppm for C4 photosynthesis) in approximately 100–900 million years. The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible. Due to the increased luminosity, Earth's mean tempearture may reach 100 °C (212 °F) in 1.5 billion years, and all ocean water will evaporate and be lost to space within an estimated 1.6 to 3 billion years. Even if the Sun were stable, a fraction of the water in the modern oceans will descend to the mantle, due to reduced steam venting from mid-ocean ridges.The Sun will evolve to become a red giant in about 5 billion years. Models predict that the Sun will expand to roughly 1 AU (150 million km; 93 million mi), about 250 times its present radius. Earth's fate is less clear. As a red giant, the Sun will lose roughly 30% of its mass, so, without tidal effects, Earth will move to an orbit 1.7 AU (250 million km; 160 million mi) from the Sun when the star reaches its maximum radius.\n",

The average diameter of the reference spheroid is 12,742 kilometres (7,918 mi). Local topography deviates from this idealized spheroid, although on a global scale these deviations are small compared to Earth's radius: the maximum deviation of only 0.17% is at the Mariana Trench (10,925 metres or 35,843 feet below local sea level), whereas Mount Everest (8,848 metres or 29,029 feet above local sea level) represents a deviation of 0.14%.\n",
      "In geodesy, the exact shape that Earth's oceans would adopt in the absence of land and perturbations such as tides and winds is called the geoid. More precisely, the geoid is the surface of gravitational equipotential at mean sea level.\n",

Due to mass segregation, the core region is estimated to be primarily composed of iron (88.8%), with smaller amounts of nickel (5.8%), sulphur (4.5%), and less than 1% trace elements.The most common rock constituents of the crust are nearly all oxides: chlorine, sulphur, and fluorine are the important exceptions to this and their total amount in any rock is usually much less than 1%.

      "=== Internal structure ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Earth's interior, like that of the other terrestrial planets, is divided into layers by their chemical or physical (rheological) properties. The outer layer is a chemically distinct silicate solid crust, which is underlain by a highly viscous solid mantle. The crust is separated from the mantle by the Mohorovičić discontinuity. The thickness of the crust varies from about 6 kilometres (3.7 mi) under the oceans to 30–50 km (19–31 mi) for the continents. The crust and the cold, rigid, top of the upper mantle are collectively known as the lithosphere, which is divided into independently moving tectonic plates.Beneath the lithosphere is the asthenosphere, a relatively low-viscosity layer on which the lithosphere rides. Important changes in crystal structure within the mantle occur at 410 and 660 km (250 and 410 mi) below the surface, spanning a transition zone that separates the upper and lower mantle. Beneath the mantle, an extremely low viscosity liquid outer core lies above a solid inner core. Earth's inner core may be rotating at a slightly higher angular velocity than the remainder of the planet, advancing by 0.1–0.5° per year, although both somewhat higher and much lower rates have also been proposed. The radius of the inner core is about one fifth of that of Earth.\n",

At the center, the temperature may be up to 6,000 °C (10,830 °F), and the pressure could reach 360 GPa (52 million psi). Because much of the heat is provided by radioactive decay, scientists postulate that early in Earth's history, before isotopes with short half-lives were depleted, Earth's heat production was much higher. At approximately 3 Gyr, twice the present-day heat would have been produced, increasing the rates of mantle convection and plate tectonics, and allowing the production of uncommon igneous rocks such as komatiites that are rarely formed today.\n",
      "\n",
      "The mean heat loss from Earth is 87 mW m−2, for a global heat loss of 4.42×1013 W. A portion of the core's thermal energy is transported toward the crust by mantle plumes, a form of convection consisting of upwellings of higher-temperature rock. These plumes can produce hotspots and flood basalts. More of the heat in Earth is lost through plate tectonics, by mantle upwelling associated with mid-ocean ridges. The final major mode of heat loss is through conduction through the lithosphere, the majority of which occurs under the oceans because the crust there is much thinner than that of the continents.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Tectonic plates ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Earth's mechanically rigid outer layer, the lithosphere, is divided into tectonic plates. These plates are rigid segments that move relative to each other at one of three boundaries types: at convergent boundaries, two plates come together; at divergent boundaries, two plates are pulled apart; and at transform boundaries, two plates slide past one another laterally. Along these plate boundaries, earthquakes, volcanic activity, mountain-building, and oceanic trench formation can occur. The tectonic plates ride on top of the asthenosphere, the solid but less-viscous part of the upper mantle that can flow and move along with the plates.As the tectonic plates migrate, oceanic crust is subducted under the leading edges of the plates at convergent boundaries. At the same time, the upwelling of mantle material at divergent boundaries creates mid-ocean ridges. The combination of these processes recycles the oceanic crust back into the mantle. Due to this recycling, most of the ocean floor is less than 100 Ma old. The oldest oceanic crust is located in the Western Pacific and is estimated to be 200 Ma old. By comparison, the oldest dated continental crust is 4,030 Ma, although zircons have been found preserved as clasts within Eoarchean sedimentary rocks that give ages up to 4,400 Ma, indicating that at least some continental crust existed at that time.The seven major plates are the Pacific, North American, Eurasian, African, Antarctic, Indo-Australian, and South American. Other notable plates include the Arabian Plate, the Caribbean Plate, the Nazca Plate off the west coast of South America and the Scotia Plate in the southern Atlantic Ocean. The Australian Plate fused with the Indian Plate between 50 and 55 Ma. The fastest-moving plates are the oceanic plates, with the Cocos Plate advancing at a rate of 75 mm/a (3.0 in/year) and the Pacific Plate moving 52–69 mm/a (2.0–2.7 in/year). At the other extreme, the slowest-moving plate is the South American Plate, progressing at a typical rate of 10.6 mm/a (0.42 in/year).\n",

Below the ocean's surface are much of the continental shelf, mountains, volcanoes, oceanic trenches, submarine canyons, oceanic plateaus, abyssal plains, and a globe-spanning mid-ocean ridge system. The remaining 29.2%, or 148.94 million km2 (57.51 million sq mi), not covered by water has terrain that varies greatly from place to place and consists of mountains, deserts, plains, plateaus, and other landforms. The elevation of the land surface varies from the low point of −418 m (−1,371 ft) at the Dead Sea, to a maximum altitude of 8,848 m (29,029 ft) at the top of Mount Everest. The mean height of land above sea level is about 797 m (2,615 ft).The continental crust consists of lower density material such as the igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust. The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, pyroxene and olivine. Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.Erosion and tectonics, volcanic eruptions, flooding, weathering, glaciation, the growth of coral reefs, and meteorite impacts are among the processes that constantly reshape Earth's surface over geological time.The pedosphere is the outermost layer of Earth's continental surface and is composed of soil and subject to soil formation processes. The total arable land is 10.9% of the land surface, with 1.3% being permanent cropland. Close to 40% of Earth's land surface is used for agriculture, or an estimated 16.7 million km2 (6.4 million sq mi) of cropland and 33.5 million km2 (12.9 million sq mi) of pastureland.\n",

The field extends outwards from the core, through the mantle, and up to Earth's surface, where it is, approximately, a dipole. The poles of the dipole are located close to Earth's geographic poles. At the equator of the magnetic field, the magnetic-field strength at the surface is 3.05×10−5 T, with a magnetic dipole moment of 7.79×1022 Am2 at epoch 2000, decreasing nearly 6% per century. The convection movements in the core are chaotic; the magnetic poles drift and periodically change alignment. This causes secular variation of the main field and field reversals at irregular intervals averaging a few times every million years.

Because the velocity of the solar wind is greater than the speed at which waves propagate through the solar wind, a supersonic bow shock precedes the dayside magnetosphere within the solar wind. Charged particles are contained within the magnetosphere; the plasmasphere is defined by low-energy particles that essentially follow magnetic field lines as Earth rotates. The ring current is defined by medium-energy particles that drift relative to the geomagnetic field, but with paths that are still dominated by the magnetic field, and the Van Allen radiation belts are formed by high-energy particles whose motion is essentially random, but contained in the magnetosphere.During magnetic storms and substorms, charged particles can be deflected from the outer magnetosphere and especially the magnetotail, directed along field lines into Earth's ionosphere, where atmospheric atoms can be excited and ionized, causing the aurora.\n",

      "Earth's rotation period relative to the Sun—its mean solar day—is 86,400 seconds of mean solar time (86,400.0025 SI seconds). Because Earth's solar day is now slightly longer than it was during the 19th century due to tidal deceleration, each day varies between 0 and 2 ms longer than the mean solar day.Earth's rotation period relative to the fixed stars, called its stellar day by the International Earth Rotation and Reference Systems Service (IERS), is 86,164.0989 seconds of mean solar time (UT1), or 23h 56m 4.0989s. Earth's rotation period relative to the precessing or moving mean March equinox (when the Sun is at 90° on the equator), is 86,164.0905 seconds of mean solar time (UT1) (23h 56m 4.0905s). Thus the sidereal day is shorter than the stellar day by about 8.4 ms.Apart from meteors within the atmosphere and low-orbiting satellites, the main apparent motion of celestial bodies in Earth's sky is to the west at a rate of 15°/h = 15'/min. For bodies near the celestial equator, this is equivalent to an apparent diameter of the Sun or the Moon every two minutes; from Earth's surface, the apparent sizes of the Sun and the Moon are approximately the same.\n",

      "=== Orbit ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Earth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150 million km (93 million mi) every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one sidereal year. This gives an apparent movement of the Sun eastward with respect to the stars at a rate of about 1°/day, which is one apparent Sun or Moon diameter every 12 hours. Due to this motion, on average it takes 24 hours—a solar day—for Earth to complete a full rotation about its axis so that the Sun returns to the meridian. The orbital speed of Earth averages about 29.78 km/s (107,200 km/h; 66,600 mph), which is fast enough to travel a distance equal to Earth's diameter, about 12,742 km (7,918 mi), in seven minutes, and the distance to the Moon, 384,000 km (239,000 mi), in about 3.5 hours.The Moon and Earth orbit a common barycenter every 27.32 days relative to the background stars. When combined with the Earth–Moon system's common orbit around the Sun, the period of the synodic month, from new moon to new moon, is 29.53 days. Viewed from the celestial north pole, the motion of Earth, the Moon, and their axial rotations are all counterclockwise. Viewed from a vantage point above the north poles of both the Sun and Earth, Earth orbits in a counterclockwise direction about the Sun. The orbital and axial planes are not precisely aligned: Earth's axis is tilted some 23.44 degrees from the perpendicular to the Earth–Sun plane (the ecliptic), and the Earth–Moon plane is tilted up to ±5.1 degrees against the Earth–Sun plane. Without this tilt, there would be an eclipse every two weeks, alternating between lunar eclipses and solar eclipses.The Hill sphere, or the sphere of gravitational influence, of Earth is about 1.5 million km (930,000 mi) in radius. This is the maximum distance at which Earth's gravitational influence is stronger than the more distant Sun and planets. Objects must orbit Earth within this radius, or they can become unbound by the gravitational perturbation of the Sun.Earth, along with the Solar System, is situated in the Milky Way and orbits about 28,000 light-years from its center. It is about 20 light-years above the galactic plane in the Orion Arm.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Axial tilt and seasons ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The axial tilt of Earth is approximately 23.439281° with the axis of its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies over the course of the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and winter taking place when the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in the sky. In winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. Above the Arctic Circle and below the Antarctic Circle there is no daylight at all for part of the year, causing a polar night, and this night extends for several months at the poles themselves. These same latitudes also experience a midnight sun, where the sun remains visible all day.By astronomical convention, the four seasons can be determined by the solstices—the points in the orbit of maximum axial tilt toward or away from the Sun—and the equinoxes, when Earth's rotational axis is aligned with its orbital axis. In the Northern Hemisphere, winter solstice currently occurs around 21 December; summer solstice is near 21 June, spring equinox is around 20 March and autumnal equinox is about 22 or 23 September. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is reversed, with the summer and winter solstices exchanged and the spring and autumnal equinox dates swapped.The angle of Earth's axial tilt is relatively stable over long periods of time. Its axial tilt does undergo nutation; a slight, irregular motion with a main period of 18.6 years. The orientation (rather than the angle) of Earth's axis also changes over time, precessing around in a complete circle over each 25,800 year cycle; this precession is the reason for the difference between a sidereal year and a tropical year. Both of these motions are caused by the varying attraction of the Sun and the Moon on Earth's equatorial bulge. The poles also migrate a few meters across Earth's surface. This polar motion has multiple, cyclical components, which collectively are termed quasiperiodic motion. In addition to an annual component to this motion, there is a 14-month cycle called the Chandler wobble. Earth's rotational velocity also varies in a phenomenon known as length-of-day variation.In modern times, Earth's perihelion occurs around 3 January, and its aphelion around 4 July. These dates change over time due to precession and other orbital factors, which follow cyclical patterns known as Milankovitch cycles. The changing Earth–Sun distance causes an increase of about 6.8% in solar energy reaching Earth at perihelion relative to aphelion. Because the Southern Hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun at about the same time that Earth reaches the closest approach to the Sun, the Southern Hemisphere receives slightly more energy from the Sun than does the northern over the course of a year. This effect is much less significant than the total energy change due to the axial tilt, and most of the excess energy is absorbed by the higher proportion of water in the Southern Hemisphere.\n",

      "\n",
      "=== Moon ===\n",
      "\n",
      "The Moon is a relatively large, terrestrial, planet-like natural satellite, with a diameter about one-quarter of Earth's. It is the largest moon in the Solar System relative to the size of its planet, although Charon is larger relative to the dwarf planet Pluto. The natural satellites of other planets are also referred to as \"moons\", after Earth's. The most widely accepted theory of the Moon's origin, the giant-impact hypothesis, states that it formed from the collision of a Mars-size protoplanet called Theia with the early Earth. This hypothesis explains (among other things) the Moon's relative lack of iron and volatile elements and the fact that its composition is nearly identical to that of Earth's crust.The gravitational attraction between Earth and the Moon causes tides on Earth. The same effect on the Moon has led to its tidal locking: its rotation period is the same as the time it takes to orbit Earth. As a result, it always presents the same face to the planet. As the Moon orbits Earth, different parts of its face are illuminated by the Sun, leading to the lunar phases. Due to their tidal interaction, the Moon recedes from Earth at the rate of approximately 38 mm/a (1.5 in/year). Over millions of years, these tiny modifications—and the lengthening of Earth's day by about 23 µs/yr—add up to significant changes. During the Ediacaran period, for example, (approximately 620 Ma) there were 400±7 days in a year, with each day lasting 21.9±0.4 hours.The Moon may have dramatically affected the development of life by moderating the planet's climate. Paleontological evidence and computer simulations show that Earth's axial tilt is stabilized by tidal interactions with the Moon. Some theorists think that without this stabilization against the torques applied by the Sun and planets to Earth's equatorial bulge, the rotational axis might be chaotically unstable, exhibiting large changes over millions of years, as is the case for Mars, though this is disputed.Viewed from Earth, the Moon is just far enough away to have almost the same apparent-sized disk as the Sun. The angular size (or solid angle) of these two bodies match because, although the Sun's diameter is about 400 times as large as the Moon's, it is also 400 times more distant. This allows total and annular solar eclipses to occur on Earth.\n",

      "=== Asteroids and artificial satellites ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Earth's co-orbital asteroids population consists of quasi-satellites, objects with a horseshoe orbit and trojans. There are at least five quasi-satellites, including 469219 Kamoʻoalewa. A trojan asteroid companion, 2010 TK7, is librating around the leading Lagrange triangular point, L4, in Earth's orbit around the Sun. The tiny near-Earth asteroid 2006 RH120 makes close approaches to the Earth–Moon system roughly every twenty years. During these approaches, it can orbit Earth for brief periods of time.As of April 2020, there are 2,666 operational, human-made satellites orbiting Earth. There are also inoperative satellites, including Vanguard 1, the oldest satellite currently in orbit, and over 16,000 pieces of tracked space debris. Earth's largest artificial satellite is the International Space Station.\n",

      "== Hydrosphere ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The abundance of water on Earth's surface is a unique feature that distinguishes the \"Blue Planet\" from other planets in the Solar System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000 m (6,600 ft). The mass of the oceans is approximately 1.35×1018 metric tons or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The oceans cover an area of 361.8 million km2 (139.7 million sq mi) with a mean depth of 3,682 m (12,080 ft), resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332 billion km3 (320 million cu mi). If all of Earth's crustal surface were at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of the resulting world ocean would be 2.7 to 2.8 km (1.68 to 1.74 mi). About 97.5% of the water is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh water. Most fresh water, about 68.7%, is present as ice in ice caps and glaciers.In Earth's coldest regions, snow survives over the summer and changes into ice. This accumulated snow and eyes eventually forms into glaciers, bodies of ice that flow under the influence of their own gravity. Alpine glaciers form in mountainous areas, whereas vast ice sheets form over land in polar regions. The flow of glaciers erodes the surface changing it dramatically, with the formation of U-shaped valleys and other landforms. Sea ice in the Arctic covers an area about as big as the United States, although it is quickly retreating as a consequence of climate change.The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams of salt per kilogram of sea water (3.5% salt). Most of this salt was released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous rocks. The oceans are also a reservoir of dissolved atmospheric gases, which are essential for the survival of many aquatic life forms. Sea water has an important influence on the world's climate, with the oceans acting as a large heat reservoir. Shifts in the oceanic temperature distribution can cause significant weather shifts, such as the El Niño–Southern Oscillation.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "== Atmosphere ==\n",
      "\n",
      "The atmospheric pressure at Earth's sea level averages 101.325 kPa (14.696 psi), with a scale height of about 8.5 km (5.3 mi). A dry atmosphere is composed of 78.084% nitrogen, 20.946% oxygen, 0.934% argon, and trace amounts of carbon dioxide and other gaseous molecules. Water vapor content varies between 0.01% and 4% but averages about 1%. The height of the troposphere varies with latitude, ranging between 8 km (5 mi) at the poles to 17 km (11 mi) at the equator, with some variation resulting from weather and seasonal factors.Earth's biosphere has significantly altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved 2.7 Gya, forming the primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled the proliferation of aerobic organisms and, indirectly, the formation of the ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18 °C (0 °F), in contrast to the current +15 °C (59 °F), and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Weather and climate ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Earth's atmosphere has no definite boundary, slowly becoming thinner and fading into outer space. Three-quarters of the atmosphere's mass is contained within the first 11 km (6.8 mi) of the surface. This lowest layer is called the troposphere. Energy from the Sun heats this layer, and the surface below, causing expansion of the air. This lower-density air then rises and is replaced by cooler, higher-density air. The result is atmospheric circulation that drives the weather and climate through redistribution of thermal energy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The primary atmospheric circulation bands consist of the trade winds in the equatorial region below 30° latitude and the westerlies in the mid-latitudes between 30° and 60°. Ocean currents are also important factors in determining climate, particularly the thermohaline circulation that distributes thermal energy from the equatorial oceans to the polar regions.The amount of solar energy reaching Earth's surface decreases with increasing latitude. At higher latitudes, the sunlight reaches the surface at lower angles, and it must pass through thicker columns of the atmosphere. As a result, the mean annual air temperature at sea level decreases by about 0.4 °C (0.7 °F) per degree of latitude from the equator. Earth's surface can be subdivided into specific latitudinal belts of approximately homogeneous climate. Ranging from the equator to the polar regions, these are the tropical (or equatorial), subtropical, temperate and polar climates.Further factors that affect a location's climates are its proximity to oceans, the oceanic and atmospheric circulation, and topology. Places close to oceans typically have colder summers and warmer winters, due to the fact that oceans can the store large amounts of heat. The wind transports the cold or the heat of the ocean to the land. Atmospheric circulation also plays an important role: San Francisco and Washington DC are both coastal cities at about the same latitude. San Francisco's climate is significantly more moderate as the prevailing wind direction is from sea to land. Finally, temperatures decrease with height causing mountainous areas to be colder than low-lying areas.Water vapor generated through surface evaporation is transported by circulatory patterns in the atmosphere. When atmospheric conditions permit an uplift of warm, humid air, this water condenses and falls to the surface as precipitation. Most of the water is then transported to lower elevations by river systems and usually returned to the oceans or deposited into lakes. This water cycle is a vital mechanism for supporting life on land and is a primary factor in the erosion of surface features over geological periods. Precipitation patterns vary widely, ranging from several meters of water per year to less than a millimeter. Atmospheric circulation, topographic features, and temperature differences determine the average precipitation that falls in each region.The commonly used Köppen climate classification system has five broad groups (humid tropics, arid, humid middle latitudes, continental and cold polar), which are further divided into more specific subtypes. The Köppen system rates regions based on observed temperature and precipitation. Surface air temperature can rise to around 55 °C (131 °F) in hot deserts, such as Death Valley, and can fall as low as −89 °C (−128 °F) in Antarctica.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "=== Upper atmosphere ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Above the troposphere, the atmosphere is usually divided into the stratosphere, mesosphere, and thermosphere. Each layer has a different lapse rate, defining the rate of change in temperature with height. Beyond these, the exosphere thins out into the magnetosphere, where the geomagnetic fields interact with the solar wind. Within the stratosphere is the ozone layer, a component that partially shields the surface from ultraviolet light and thus is important for life on Earth. The Kármán line, defined as 100 km above Earth's surface, is a working definition for the boundary between the atmosphere and outer space.Thermal energy causes some of the molecules at the outer edge of the atmosphere to increase their velocity to the point where they can escape from Earth's gravity. This causes a slow but steady loss of the atmosphere into space. Because unfixed hydrogen has a low molecular mass, it can achieve escape velocity more readily, and it leaks into outer space at a greater rate than other gases. The leakage of hydrogen into space contributes to the shifting of Earth's atmosphere and surface from an initially reducing state to its current oxidizing one. Photosynthesis provided a source of free oxygen, but the loss of reducing agents such as hydrogen is thought to have been a necessary precondition for the widespread accumulation of oxygen in the atmosphere. Hence the ability of hydrogen to escape from the atmosphere may have influenced the nature of life that developed on Earth. In the current, oxygen-rich atmosphere most hydrogen is converted into water before it has an opportunity to escape. Instead, most of the hydrogen loss comes from the destruction of methane in the upper atmosphere.\n",

      "== Life on Earth ==\n",
      "\n",
      "A planet's life forms inhabit ecosystems, whose total forms the biosphere. The biosphere is divided into a number of biomes, inhabited by broadly similar plants and animals. On land, biomes are separated primarily by differences in latitude, height above sea level and humidity. Terrestrial biomes lying within the Arctic or Antarctic Circles, at high altitudes or in extremely arid areas are relatively barren of plant and animal life; species diversity reaches a peak in humid lowlands at equatorial latitudes. Estimates of the number of species on Earth today vary; most species have not been described.A planet that can sustain life is termed habitable, even if life did not originate there. Earth provides liquid water—an environment where complex organic molecules can assemble and interact, and sufficient energy to sustain metabolism. Plants can take up nutrients from the atmosphere, soils and water. These nutrients are constantly recycled between different species. The distance of Earth from the Sun, as well as its orbital eccentricity, rate of rotation, axial tilt, geological history, sustaining atmosphere, and magnetic field all contribute to the current climatic conditions at the surface.Extreme weather, such as tropical cyclones (including hurricanes and typhoons), occurs over most of Earth's surface and has a large impact on life in those areas. From 1980 to 2000, these events caused an average of 11,800 human deaths per year. Many places are subject to earthquakes, landslides, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, tornadoes, blizzards, floods, droughts, wildfires, and other calamities and disasters. Human impact is felt in many areas due to pollution of the air and water, acid rain, loss of vegetation (overgrazing, deforestation, desertification), loss of wildlife, species extinction, soil degradation, soil depletion and erosion. There is a scientific consensus that humans are causing global warming by releasing greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. This is driving changes such as the melting of glaciers and ice sheets, a global rise in average sea levels, and significant shifts in weather.\n",

      "\n",
      "Earth's human population passed seven billion in the early 2010s, and is projected to peak at around ten billion in the second half of the 21st century. Most of the growth is expected to take place in sub-Saharan Africa. Human population density varies widely around the world, but a majority live in Asia. By 2050, 68% of the world's population is expected to be living in urban, rather than rural, areas. 68% of the land mass of the world is in the Northern Hemisphere. Partly due to the predominance of land mass, 90% of humans live in the Northern Hemisphere.It is estimated that one-eighth of Earth's surface is suitable for humans to live on – three-quarters of Earth's surface is covered by oceans, leaving one-quarter as land. Half of that land area is desert (14%), high mountains (27%), or other unsuitable terrains. States claim the planet's entire land surface, except for parts of Antarctica and a few other unclaimed areas. Earth has never had a planetwide government, but the United Nations is the leading worldwide intergovernmental organization.The first human to orbit Earth was Yuri Gagarin on 12 April 1961. In total, about 550 people have visited outer space and reached orbit as of November 2018, and, of these, twelve have walked on the Moon. Normally, the only humans in space are those on the International Space Station. The station's crew, made up of six people, is usually replaced every six months. The farthest that humans have traveled from Earth is 400,171 km (248,655 mi), achieved during the Apollo 13 mission in 1970.\n",

      "=== Natural resources and land use ===\n",
      "\n",
      "Earth has resources that have been exploited by humans. Those termed non-renewable resources, such as fossil fuels, only renew over geological timescales. Large deposits of fossil fuels are obtained from Earth's crust, consisting of coal, petroleum, and natural gas. These deposits are used by humans both for energy production and as feedstock for chemical production. Mineral ore bodies have also been formed within the crust through a process of ore genesis, resulting from actions of magmatism, erosion, and plate tectonics. These metals and other elements are extracted by mining, a process which often brings environmental and health damage.Earth's biosphere produces many useful biological products for humans, including food, wood, pharmaceuticals, oxygen, and the recycling of organic waste. The land-based ecosystem depends upon topsoil and fresh water, and the oceanic ecosystem depends on dissolved nutrients washed down from the land. In 2019, 39 million km2 (15 million sq mi) of Earth's land surface consisted of forest and woodlands, 12 million km2 (4.6 million sq mi) was shrub and grassland, 40 million km2 (15 million sq mi) were used for animal feed production and grazing, and 11 million km2 (4.2 million sq mi) were cultivated as croplands. Of the 12–14% of ice-free land that is used for croplands, 2 percent point was irrigated in 2015. Humans use building materials to construct shelters.\n",

      "\n",
      "Human cultures have developed many views of the planet. The standard astronomical symbol of Earth consists of a cross circumscribed by a circle, , representing the four corners of the world. Earth is sometimes personified as a deity. In many cultures it is a mother goddess that is also the primary fertility deity. Creation myths in many religions involve the creation of Earth by a supernatural deity or deities. The Gaia Principle, developed mid-20th century, compared Earth's environments and life as a single self-regulating organism leading to broad stabilization of the conditions of habitability. Images of Earth taken from space, particularly during the Apollo program, have been credited with altering the way that people viewed the planet that they lived on, emphasising its beauty, uniqueness and apparent fragility.Scientific investigation has resulted in several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. Initial belief in a flat Earth was gradually displaced in Ancient Greece by the idea of a spherical Earth, which was attributed to both the philosophers Pythagoras and Parmenides. Earth was generally believed to be the center of the universe until the 16th century, when scientists first conclusively demonstrated that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System.It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years. Lord Kelvin used thermodynamics to estimate the age of Earth to be between 20 million and 400 million years in 1864, sparking a vigorous debate on the subject; it was only when radioactivity and radioactive dating were discovered in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that a reliable mechanism for determining Earth's age was established, proving the planet to be billions of years old.\n",

      "You will rejoice to hear that no disaster has accompanied the\r\n",

      "of my undertaking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I am already far north of London, and as I walk in the streets of\r\n",
      "Petersburgh, I feel a cold northern breeze play upon my cheeks, which\r\n",
      "braces my nerves and fills me with delight.  Do you understand this\r\n",
      "feeling?  This breeze, which has travelled from the regions towards\r\n",
      "which I am advancing, gives me a foretaste of those icy climes.\r\n",
      "Inspirited by this wind of promise, my daydreams become more fervent\r\n",
      "and vivid.  I try in vain to be persuaded that the pole is the seat of\r\n",
      "frost and desolation; it ever presents itself to my imagination as the\r\n",
      "region of beauty and delight.  There, Margaret, the sun is for ever\r\n",
      "visible, its broad disk just skirting the horizon and diffusing a\r\n",
      "perpetual splendour.  Thereâfor with your leave, my sister, I will put\r\n",
      "some trust in preceding navigatorsâthere snow and frost are banished;\r\n",
      "and, sailing over a calm sea, we may be wafted to a land surpassing in\r\n",

      "globe.  Its productions and features may be without example, as the\r\n",

      "regulate a thousand celestial observations that require only this\r\n",
      "voyage to render their seeming eccentricities consistent for ever.  I\r\n",

      "never before visited, and may tread a land never before imprinted by\r\n",
      "the foot of man. These are my enticements, and they are sufficient to\r\n",
      "conquer all fear of danger or death and to induce me to commence this\r\n",
      "laborious voyage with the joy a child feels when he embarks in a little\r\n",

      "cannot contest the inestimable benefit which I shall confer on all\r\n",
      "mankind, to the last generation, by discovering a passage near the pole\r\n",
      "to those countries, to reach which at present so many months are\r\n",

      "all possible, can only be effected by an undertaking such as mine.\r\n",

      "These reflections have dispelled the agitation with which I began my\r\n",
      "letter, and I feel my heart glow with an enthusiasm which elevates me\r\n",
      "to heaven, for nothing contributes so much to tranquillise the mind as\r\n",
      "a steady purposeâa point on which the soul may fix its intellectual\r\n",
      "eye.  This expedition has been the favourite dream of my early years. I\r\n",
      "have read with ardour the accounts of the various voyages which have\r\n",
      "been made in the prospect of arriving at the North Pacific Ocean\r\n",
      "through the seas which surround the pole.  You may remember that a\r\n",
      "history of all the voyages made for purposes of discovery composed the\r\n",
      "whole of our good Uncle Thomasâ library.  My education was neglected,\r\n",
      "yet I was passionately fond of reading.  These volumes were my study\r\n",
      "day and night, and my familiarity with them increased that regret which\r\n",
      "I had felt, as a child, on learning that my fatherâs dying injunction\r\n",
      "had forbidden my uncle to allow me to embark in a seafaring life.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These visions faded when I perused, for the first time, those poets\r\n",
      "whose effusions entranced my soul and lifted it to heaven.  I also\r\n",
      "became a poet and for one year lived in a paradise of my own creation;\r\n",
      "I imagined that I also might obtain a niche in the temple where the\r\n",
      "names of Homer and Shakespeare are consecrated.  You are well\r\n",
      "acquainted with my failure and how heavily I bore the disappointment.\r\n",
      "But just at that time I inherited the fortune of my cousin, and my\r\n",
      "thoughts were turned into the channel of their earlier bent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Six years have passed since I resolved on my present undertaking.  I\r\n",
      "can, even now, remember the hour from which I dedicated myself to this\r\n",
      "great enterprise.  I commenced by inuring my body to hardship.  I\r\n",
      "accompanied the whale-fishers on several expeditions to the North Sea;\r\n",
      "I voluntarily endured cold, famine, thirst, and want of sleep; I often\r\n",
      "worked harder than the common sailors during the day and devoted my\r\n",
      "nights to the study of mathematics, the theory of medicine, and those\r\n",
      "branches of physical science from which a naval adventurer might derive\r\n",
      "the greatest practical advantage.  Twice I actually hired myself as an\r\n",
      "under-mate in a Greenland whaler, and acquitted myself to admiration. I\r\n",
      "must own I felt a little proud when my captain offered me the second\r\n",
      "dignity in the vessel and entreated me to remain with the greatest\r\n",
      "earnestness, so valuable did he consider my services.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And now, dear Margaret, do I not deserve to accomplish some great purpose?\r\n",
      "My life might have been passed in ease and luxury, but I preferred glory to\r\n",
      "every enticement that wealth placed in my path. Oh, that some encouraging\r\n",
      "voice would answer in the affirmative! My courage and my resolution is\r\n",
      "firm; but my hopes fluctuate, and my spirits are often depressed. I am\r\n",
      "about to proceed on a long and difficult voyage, the emergencies of which\r\n",
      "will demand all my fortitude: I am required not only to raise the spirits\r\n",
      "of others, but sometimes to sustain my own, when theirs are failing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This is the most favourable period for travelling in Russia.  They fly\r\n",
      "quickly over the snow in their sledges; the motion is pleasant, and, in\r\n",
      "my opinion, far more agreeable than that of an English stagecoach.  The\r\n",
      "cold is not excessive, if you are wrapped in fursâa dress which I have\r\n",
      "already adopted, for there is a great difference between walking the\r\n",
      "deck and remaining seated motionless for hours, when no exercise\r\n",
      "prevents the blood from actually freezing in your veins.  I have no\r\n",
      "ambition to lose my life on the post-road between St. Petersburgh and\r\n",
      "Archangel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I shall depart for the latter town in a fortnight or three weeks; and my\r\n",
      "intention is to hire a ship there, which can easily be done by paying the\r\n",
      "insurance for the owner, and to engage as many sailors as I think necessary\r\n",
      "among those who are accustomed to the whale-fishing. I do not intend to\r\n",
      "sail until the month of June; and when shall I return? Ah, dear sister, how\r\n",
      "can I answer this question? If I succeed, many, many months, perhaps years,\r\n",

      "friend, Margaret: when I am glowing with the enthusiasm of success, there\r\n",

      "bitterly feel the want of a friend. I have no one near me, gentle yet\r\n",
      "courageous, possessed of a cultivated as well as of a capacious mind, whose\r\n",
      "tastes are like my own, to approve or amend my plans. How would such a\r\n",
      "friend repair the faults of your poor brother! I am too ardent in execution\r\n",
      "and too impatient of difficulties. But it is a still greater evil to me\r\n",
      "that I am self-educated: for the first fourteen years of my life I ran wild\r\n",
      "on a common and read nothing but our Uncle Thomasâ books of voyages.\r\n",
      "At that age I became acquainted with the celebrated poets of our own\r\n",
      "country; but it was only when it had ceased to be in my power to derive its\r\n",
      "most important benefits from such a conviction that I perceived the\r\n",
      "necessity of becoming acquainted with more languages than that of my native\r\n",
      "country. Now I am twenty-eight and am in reality more illiterate than many\r\n",
      "schoolboys of fifteen. It is true that I have thought more and that my\r\n",
      "daydreams are more extended and magnificent, but they want (as the painters\r\n",
      "call it) _keeping;_ and I greatly need a friend who would have sense\r\n",

      "endeavour to regulate my mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Well, these are useless complaints; I shall certainly find no friend on the\r\n",
      "wide ocean, nor even here in Archangel, among merchants and seamen. Yet\r\n",
      "some feelings, unallied to the dross of human nature, beat even in these\r\n",
      "rugged bosoms. My lieutenant, for instance, is a man of wonderful courage\r\n",
      "and enterprise; he is madly desirous of glory, or rather, to word my phrase\r\n",
      "more characteristically, of advancement in his profession. He is an\r\n",
      "Englishman, and in the midst of national and professional prejudices,\r\n",
      "unsoftened by cultivation, retains some of the noblest endowments of\r\n",
      "humanity. I first became acquainted with him on board a whale vessel;\r\n",
      "finding that he was unemployed in this city, I easily engaged him to assist\r\n",
      "in my enterprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The master is a person of an excellent disposition and is remarkable in the\r\n",
      "ship for his gentleness and the mildness of his discipline. This\r\n",
      "circumstance, added to his well-known integrity and dauntless courage, made\r\n",
      "me very desirous to engage him. A youth passed in solitude, my best years\r\n",
      "spent under your gentle and feminine fosterage, has so refined the\r\n",
      "groundwork of my character that I cannot overcome an intense distaste to\r\n",
      "the usual brutality exercised on board ship: I have never believed it to be\r\n",
      "necessary, and when I heard of a mariner equally noted for his kindliness\r\n",
      "of heart and the respect and obedience paid to him by his crew, I felt\r\n",
      "myself peculiarly fortunate in being able to secure his services. I heard\r\n",
      "of him first in rather a romantic manner, from a lady who owes to him the\r\n",
      "happiness of her life. This, briefly, is his story. Some years ago he loved\r\n",
      "a young Russian lady of moderate fortune, and having amassed a considerable\r\n",
      "sum in prize-money, the father of the girl consented to the match. He saw\r\n",
      "his mistress once before the destined ceremony; but she was bathed in\r\n",
      "tears, and throwing herself at his feet, entreated him to spare her,\r\n",
      "confessing at the same time that she loved another, but that he was poor,\r\n",
      "and that her father would never consent to the union. My generous friend\r\n",
      "reassured the suppliant, and on being informed of the name of her lover,\r\n",
      "instantly abandoned his pursuit. He had already bought a farm with his\r\n",
      "money, on which he had designed to pass the remainder of his life; but he\r\n",
      "bestowed the whole on his rival, together with the remains of his\r\n",
      "prize-money to purchase stock, and then himself solicited the young\r\n",
      "womanâs father to consent to her marriage with her lover. But the old\r\n",
      "man decidedly refused, thinking himself bound in honour to my friend, who,\r\n",
      "when he found the father inexorable, quitted his country, nor returned\r\n",
      "until he heard that his former mistress was married according to her\r\n",
      "inclinations. âWhat a noble fellow!â you will exclaim. He is\r\n",
      "so; but then he is wholly uneducated: he is as silent as a Turk, and a kind\r\n",
      "of ignorant carelessness attends him, which, while it renders his conduct\r\n",
      "the more astonishing, detracts from the interest and sympathy which\r\n",
      "otherwise he would command.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet do not suppose, because I complain a little or because I can\r\n",
      "conceive a consolation for my toils which I may never know, that I am\r\n",
      "wavering in my resolutions.  Those are as fixed as fate, and my voyage\r\n",
      "is only now delayed until the weather shall permit my embarkation.  The\r\n",
      "winter has been dreadfully severe, but the spring promises well, and it\r\n",
      "is considered as a remarkably early season, so that perhaps I may sail\r\n",
      "sooner than I expected.  I shall do nothing rashly:  you know me\r\n",
      "sufficiently to confide in my prudence and considerateness whenever the\r\n",
      "safety of others is committed to my care.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I cannot describe to you my sensations on the near prospect of my\r\n",
      "undertaking.  It is impossible to communicate to you a conception of\r\n",
      "the trembling sensation, half pleasurable and half fearful, with which\r\n",
      "I am preparing to depart.  I am going to unexplored regions, to âthe\r\n",
      "land of mist and snow,â but I shall kill no albatross; therefore do not\r\n",
      "be alarmed for my safety or if I should come back to you as worn and\r\n",
      "woeful as the âAncient Mariner.â  You will smile at my allusion, but I\r\n",
      "will disclose a secret.  I have often attributed my attachment to, my\r\n",
      "passionate enthusiasm for, the dangerous mysteries of ocean to that\r\n",
      "production of the most imaginative of modern poets.  There is something\r\n",

      "have no end.  Some of my comrades groaned, and my own mind began to\r\n",
      "grow watchful with anxious thoughts, when a strange sight suddenly\r\n",
      "attracted our attention and diverted our solicitude from our own\r\n",
      "situation.  We perceived a low carriage, fixed on a sledge and drawn by\r\n",
      "dogs, pass on towards the north, at the distance of half a mile; a\r\n",
      "being which had the shape of a man, but apparently of gigantic stature,\r\n",
      "sat in the sledge and guided the dogs.  We watched the rapid progress\r\n",
      "of the traveller with our telescopes until he was lost among the\r\n",
      "distant inequalities of the ice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This appearance excited our unqualified wonder. We were, as we believed,\r\n",
      "many hundred miles from any land; but this apparition seemed to denote that\r\n",
      "it was not, in reality, so distant as we had supposed. Shut in, however, by\r\n",
      "ice, it was impossible to follow his track, which we had observed with the\r\n",
      "greatest attention.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About two hours after this occurrence we heard the ground sea, and before\r\n",
      "night the ice broke and freed our ship. We, however, lay to until the\r\n",
      "morning, fearing to encounter in the dark those large loose masses which\r\n",
      "float about after the breaking up of the ice. I profited of this time to\r\n",
      "rest for a few hours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the morning, however, as soon as it was light, I went upon deck and\r\n",
      "found all the sailors busy on one side of the vessel, apparently\r\n",
      "talking to someone in the sea.  It was, in fact, a sledge, like that we\r\n",
      "had seen before, which had drifted towards us in the night on a large\r\n",
      "fragment of ice.  Only one dog remained alive; but there was a human\r\n",
      "being within it whom the sailors were persuading to enter the vessel.\r\n",
      "He was not, as the other traveller seemed to be, a savage inhabitant of\r\n",
      "some undiscovered island, but a European.  When I appeared on deck the\r\n",
      "master said, âHere is our captain, and he will not allow you to perish\r\n",
      "on the open sea.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On perceiving me, the stranger addressed me in English, although with a\r\n",
      "foreign accent.  âBefore I come on board your vessel,â said he,\r\n",
      "âwill you have the kindness to inform me whither you are bound?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "You may conceive my astonishment on hearing such a question addressed\r\n",
      "to me from a man on the brink of destruction and to whom I should have\r\n",
      "supposed that my vessel would have been a resource which he would not\r\n",
      "have exchanged for the most precious wealth the earth can afford.  I\r\n",
      "replied, however, that we were on a voyage of discovery towards the\r\n",
      "northern pole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Upon hearing this he appeared satisfied and consented to come on board.\r\n",
      "Good God!  Margaret, if you had seen the man who thus capitulated for\r\n",
      "his safety, your surprise would have been boundless.  His limbs were\r\n",
      "nearly frozen, and his body dreadfully emaciated by fatigue and\r\n",
      "suffering.  I never saw a man in so wretched a condition.  We attempted\r\n",
      "to carry him into the cabin, but as soon as he had quitted the fresh\r\n",
      "air he fainted.  We accordingly brought him back to the deck and\r\n",
      "restored him to animation by rubbing him with brandy and forcing him to\r\n",
      "swallow a small quantity.  As soon as he showed signs of life we\r\n",
      "wrapped him up in blankets and placed him near the chimney of the\r\n",
      "kitchen stove.  By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup,\r\n",
      "which restored him wonderfully.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak, and I often\r\n",
      "feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.  When he\r\n",
      "had in some measure recovered, I removed him to my own cabin and\r\n",
      "attended on him as much as my duty would permit.  I never saw a more\r\n",
      "interesting creature:  his eyes have generally an expression of\r\n",
      "wildness, and even madness, but there are moments when, if anyone\r\n",
      "performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most\r\n",
      "trifling service, his whole countenance is lighted up, as it were, with\r\n",
      "a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.  But he\r\n",
      "is generally melancholy and despairing, and sometimes he gnashes his\r\n",
      "teeth, as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off\r\n",
      "the men, who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not\r\n",
      "allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity, in a state of body\r\n",
      "and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.\r\n",
      "Once, however, the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice\r\n",
      "in so strange a vehicle.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom, and\r\n",
      "he replied, âTo seek one who fled from me.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen I fancy we have seen him, for the day before we picked you up we\r\n",
      "saw some dogs drawing a sledge, with a man in it, across the ice.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This aroused the strangerâs attention, and he asked a multitude of\r\n",
      "questions concerning the route which the dÃ¦mon, as he called him, had\r\n",
      "pursued.  Soon after, when he was alone with me, he said, âI have,\r\n",
      "doubtless, excited your curiosity, as well as that of these good\r\n",
      "people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âCertainly; it would indeed be very impertinent and inhuman in me to\r\n",
      "trouble you with any inquisitiveness of mine.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd yet you rescued me from a strange and perilous situation; you have\r\n",
      "benevolently restored me to life.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the\r\n",
      "ice had destroyed the other sledge.  I replied that I could not answer\r\n",
      "with any degree of certainty, for the ice had not broken until near\r\n",
      "midnight, and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety\r\n",
      "before that time; but of this I could not judge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the\r\n",
      "stranger. He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for\r\n",
      "the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in\r\n",
      "the cabin, for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.\r\n",

      "Yet his manners are so conciliating and gentle that the sailors are all\r\n",
      "interested in him, although they have had very little communication\r\n",
      "with him.  For my own part, I begin to love him as a brother, and his\r\n",
      "constant and deep grief fills me with sympathy and compassion.  He must\r\n",
      "have been a noble creature in his better days, being even now in wreck\r\n",

      "which rendered it necessary that he should approve highly to love\r\n",
      "strongly.  Perhaps during former years he had suffered from the\r\n",
      "late-discovered unworthiness of one beloved and so was disposed to set\r\n",
      "a greater value on tried worth.  There was a show of gratitude and\r\n",
      "worship in his attachment to my mother, differing wholly from the\r\n",
      "doting fondness of age, for it was inspired by reverence for her\r\n",
      "virtues and a desire to be the means of, in some degree, recompensing\r\n",
      "her for the sorrows she had endured, but which gave inexpressible grace\r\n",

      "sheltered by the gardener, from every rougher wind and to surround her\r\n",

      "them by Heaven, whom to bring up to good, and whose future lot it was in\r\n",
      "their hands to direct to happiness or misery, according as they fulfilled\r\n",

      "towards the being to which they had given life, added to the active spirit\r\n",
      "of tenderness that animated both, it may be imagined that while during\r\n",
      "every hour of my infant life I received a lesson of patience, of charity,\r\n",
      "and of self-control, I was so guided by a silken cord that all seemed but\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "For a long time I was their only care. My mother had much desired to have a\r\n",

      "years old, while making an excursion beyond the frontiers of Italy, they\r\n",
      "passed a week on the shores of the Lake of Como. Their benevolent\r\n",
      "disposition often made them enter the cottages of the poor. This, to my\r\n",
      "mother, was more than a duty; it was a necessity, a\r\n",
      "passionâremembering what she had suffered, and how she had been\r\n",
      "relievedâfor her to act in her turn the guardian angel to the\r\n",
      "afflicted. During one of their walks a poor cot in the foldings of a vale\r\n",
      "attracted their notice as being singularly disconsolate, while the number\r\n",
      "of half-clothed children gathered about it spoke of penury in its worst\r\n",
      "shape. One day, when my father had gone by himself to Milan, my mother,\r\n",
      "accompanied by me, visited this abode. She found a peasant and his wife,\r\n",
      "hard working, bent down by care and labour, distributing a scanty meal to\r\n",
      "five hungry babes. Among these there was one which attracted my mother far\r\n",
      "above all the rest. She appeared of a different stock. The four others were\r\n",
      "dark-eyed, hardy little vagrants; this child was thin and very fair. Her\r\n",
      "hair was the brightest living gold, and despite the poverty of her\r\n",
      "clothing, seemed to set a crown of distinction on her head. Her brow was\r\n",
      "clear and ample, her blue eyes cloudless, and her lips and the moulding of\r\n",
      "her face so expressive of sensibility and sweetness that none could behold\r\n",
      "her without looking on her as of a distinct species, a being heaven-sent,\r\n",
      "and bearing a celestial stamp in all her features.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The peasant woman, perceiving that my mother fixed eyes of wonder and\r\n",
      "admiration on this lovely girl, eagerly communicated her history. She was\r\n",
      "not her child, but the daughter of a Milanese nobleman. Her mother was a\r\n",
      "German and had died on giving her birth. The infant had been placed with\r\n",
      "these good people to nurse: they were better off then. They had not been\r\n",
      "long married, and their eldest child was but just born. The father of their\r\n",

      "of Italyâone among the _schiavi ognor frementi,_ who exerted\r\n",
      "himself to obtain the liberty of his country. He became the victim of its\r\n",
      "weakness. Whether he had died or still lingered in the dungeons of Austria\r\n",
      "was not known. His property was confiscated; his child became an orphan and\r\n",
      "a beggar. She continued with her foster parents and bloomed in their rude\r\n",
      "abode, fairer than a garden rose among dark-leaved brambles.\r\n",

      "than the chamois of the hills. The apparition was soon explained. With his\r\n",
      "permission my mother prevailed on her rustic guardians to yield their\r\n",
      "charge to her. They were fond of the sweet orphan. Her presence had seemed\r\n",
      "a blessing to them, but it would be unfair to her to keep her in poverty\r\n",

      "totally unfitted for the company of strangers.  Such were my reflections as\r\n",
      "I commenced my journey; but as I proceeded, my spirits and hopes rose.  I\r\n",

      "said, âreally spent your time in studying such nonsense?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I replied in the affirmative.  âEvery minute,â continued M. Krempe with\r\n",
      "warmth, âevery instant that you have wasted on those books is utterly\r\n",
      "and entirely lost.  You have burdened your memory with exploded systems\r\n",

      "where no one was kind enough to inform you that these fancies which you\r\n",
      "have so greedily imbibed are a thousand years old and as musty as they\r\n",
      "are ancient?  I little expected, in this enlightened and scientific\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "So saying, he stepped aside and wrote down a list of several books\r\n",
      "treating of natural philosophy which he desired me to procure, and\r\n",
      "dismissed me after mentioning that in the beginning of the following\r\n",
      "week he intended to commence a course of lectures upon natural\r\n",
      "philosophy in its general relations, and that M. Waldman, a fellow\r\n",
      "professor, would lecture upon chemistry the alternate days that he\r\n",
      "omitted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I returned home not disappointed, for I have said that I had long\r\n",
      "considered those authors useless whom the professor reprobated; but I\r\n",
      "returned not at all the more inclined to recur to these studies in any\r\n",
      "shape.  M. Krempe was a little squat man with a gruff voice and a\r\n",
      "repulsive countenance; the teacher, therefore, did not prepossess me in\r\n",
      "favour of his pursuits.  In rather a too philosophical and connected a\r\n",
      "strain, perhaps, I have given an account of the conclusions I had come\r\n",
      "to concerning them in my early years.  As a child I had not been\r\n",
      "content with the results promised by the modern professors of natural\r\n",
      "science.  With a confusion of ideas only to be accounted for by my\r\n",
      "extreme youth and my want of a guide on such matters, I had retrod the\r\n",
      "steps of knowledge along the paths of time and exchanged the\r\n",
      "discoveries of recent inquirers for the dreams of forgotten alchemists.\r\n",
      "Besides, I had a contempt for the uses of modern natural philosophy.\r\n",
      "It was very different when the masters of the science sought\r\n",
      "immortality and power; such views, although futile, were grand; but now\r\n",
      "the scene was changed.  The ambition of the inquirer seemed to limit\r\n",
      "itself to the annihilation of those visions on which my interest in\r\n",
      "science was chiefly founded.  I was required to exchange chimeras of\r\n",
      "boundless grandeur for realities of little worth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such were my reflections during the first two or three days of my\r\n",
      "residence at Ingolstadt, which were chiefly spent in becoming\r\n",
      "acquainted with the localities and the principal residents in my new\r\n",
      "abode.  But as the ensuing week commenced, I thought of the information\r\n",
      "which M. Krempe had given me concerning the lectures.  And although I\r\n",
      "could not consent to go and hear that little conceited fellow deliver\r\n",
      "sentences out of a pulpit, I recollected what he had said of M.\r\n",
      "Waldman, whom I had never seen, as he had hitherto been out of town.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Partly from curiosity and partly from idleness, I went into the lecturing\r\n",
      "room, which M. Waldman entered shortly after. This professor was very\r\n",
      "unlike his colleague. He appeared about fifty years of age, but with an\r\n",
      "aspect expressive of the greatest benevolence; a few grey hairs covered his\r\n",
      "temples, but those at the back of his head were nearly black. His person\r\n",
      "was short but remarkably erect and his voice the sweetest I had ever heard.\r\n",
      "He began his lecture by a recapitulation of the history of chemistry and\r\n",
      "the various improvements made by different men of learning, pronouncing\r\n",
      "with fervour the names of the most distinguished discoverers. He then took\r\n",
      "a cursory view of the present state of the science and explained many of\r\n",
      "its elementary terms. After having made a few preparatory experiments, he\r\n",
      "concluded with a panegyric upon modern chemistry, the terms of which I\r\n",
      "shall never forget:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe ancient teachers of this science,â said he,\r\n",
      "âpromised impossibilities and performed nothing. The modern masters\r\n",
      "promise very little; they know that metals cannot be transmuted and that\r\n",
      "the elixir of life is a chimera but these philosophers, whose hands seem\r\n",
      "only made to dabble in dirt, and their eyes to pore over the microscope or\r\n",
      "crucible, have indeed performed miracles. They penetrate into the recesses\r\n",
      "of nature and show how she works in her hiding-places. They ascend into the\r\n",
      "heavens; they have discovered how the blood circulates, and the nature of\r\n",
      "the air we breathe. They have acquired new and almost unlimited powers;\r\n",
      "they can command the thunders of heaven, mimic the earthquake, and even\r\n",
      "mock the invisible world with its own shadows.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Such were the professorâs wordsârather let me say such the words of\r\n",
      "the fateâenounced to destroy me.  As he went on I felt as if my soul\r\n",
      "were grappling with a palpable enemy; one by one the various keys were\r\n",
      "touched which formed the mechanism of my being; chord after chord was\r\n",
      "sounded, and soon my mind was filled with one thought, one conception,\r\n",
      "one purpose.  So much has been done, exclaimed the soul of\r\n",
      "Frankensteinâmore, far more, will I achieve; treading in the steps\r\n",
      "already marked, I will pioneer a new way, explore unknown powers, and\r\n",
      "unfold to the world the deepest mysteries of creation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I closed not my eyes that night.  My internal being was in a state of\r\n",
      "insurrection and turmoil; I felt that order would thence arise, but I\r\n",
      "had no power to produce it.  By degrees, after the morningâs dawn,\r\n",
      "sleep came.  I awoke, and my yesternightâs thoughts were as a dream.\r\n",
      "There only remained a resolution to return to my ancient studies and to\r\n",
      "devote myself to a science for which I believed myself to possess a\r\n",
      "natural talent.  On the same day I paid M. Waldman a visit.  His\r\n",
      "manners in private were even more mild and attractive than in public,\r\n",
      "for there was a certain dignity in his mien during his lecture which in\r\n",
      "his own house was replaced by the greatest affability and kindness.  I\r\n",
      "gave him pretty nearly the same account of my former pursuits as I had\r\n",
      "given to his fellow professor.  He heard with attention the little\r\n",
      "narration concerning my studies and smiled at the names of Cornelius\r\n",
      "Agrippa and Paracelsus, but without the contempt that M. Krempe had\r\n",
      "exhibited. He said that âThese were men to whose indefatigable zeal\r\n",
      "modern philosophers were indebted for most of the foundations of their\r\n",
      "knowledge.  They had left to us, as an easier task, to give new names\r\n",
      "and arrange in connected classifications the facts which they in a\r\n",
      "great degree had been the instruments of bringing to light.  The\r\n",
      "labours of men of genius, however erroneously directed, scarcely ever\r\n",
      "fail in ultimately turning to the solid advantage of mankind.â  I\r\n",
      "listened to his statement, which was delivered without any presumption\r\n",
      "or affectation, and then added that his lecture had removed my\r\n",
      "prejudices against modern chemists; I expressed myself in measured\r\n",
      "terms, with the modesty and deference due from a youth to his\r\n",
      "instructor, without letting escape (inexperience in life would have\r\n",
      "made me ashamed) any of the enthusiasm which stimulated my intended\r\n",
      "labours.  I requested his advice concerning the books I ought to\r\n",
      "procure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI am happy,â said M. Waldman, âto have gained a\r\n",
      "disciple; and if your application equals your ability, I have no doubt of\r\n",
      "your success. Chemistry is that branch of natural philosophy in which the\r\n",
      "greatest improvements have been and may be made; it is on that account that\r\n",
      "I have made it my peculiar study; but at the same time, I have not\r\n",
      "neglected the other branches of science. A man would make but a very sorry\r\n",
      "chemist if he attended to that department of human knowledge alone. If your\r\n",
      "wish is to become really a man of science and not merely a petty\r\n",
      "experimentalist, I should advise you to apply to every branch of natural\r\n",
      "philosophy, including mathematics.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his\r\n",
      "various machines, instructing me as to what I ought to procure and\r\n",
      "promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in\r\n",
      "the science not to derange their mechanism. He also gave me the list of\r\n",
      "books which I had requested, and I took my leave.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "From this day natural philosophy, and particularly chemistry, in the\r\n",
      "most comprehensive sense of the term, became nearly my sole occupation.\r\n",
      "I read with ardour those works, so full of genius and discrimination,\r\n",
      "which modern inquirers have written on these subjects.  I attended the\r\n",
      "lectures and cultivated the acquaintance of the men of science of the\r\n",
      "university, and I found even in M. Krempe a great deal of sound sense\r\n",
      "and real information, combined, it is true, with a repulsive\r\n",
      "physiognomy and manners, but not on that account the less valuable.  In\r\n",
      "M. Waldman I found a true friend.  His gentleness was never tinged by\r\n",
      "dogmatism, and his instructions were given with an air of frankness and\r\n",
      "good nature that banished every idea of pedantry.  In a thousand ways\r\n",
      "he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse\r\n",
      "inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.  My application was at\r\n",
      "first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and\r\n",
      "soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the\r\n",
      "light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I applied so closely, it may be easily conceived that my progress\r\n",
      "was rapid.  My ardour was indeed the astonishment of the students, and\r\n",
      "my proficiency that of the masters.  Professor Krempe often asked me,\r\n",
      "with a sly smile, how Cornelius Agrippa went on, whilst M. Waldman\r\n",
      "expressed the most heartfelt exultation in my progress.  Two years\r\n",
      "passed in this manner, during which I paid no visit to Geneva, but was\r\n",
      "engaged, heart and soul, in the pursuit of some discoveries which I\r\n",
      "hoped to make.  None but those who have experienced them can conceive\r\n",
      "of the enticements of science.  In other studies you go as far as\r\n",
      "others have gone before you, and there is nothing more to know; but in\r\n",
      "a scientific pursuit there is continual food for discovery and wonder.\r\n",
      "A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must\r\n",
      "infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I, who\r\n",
      "continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was\r\n",
      "solely wrapped up in this, improved so rapidly that at the end of two\r\n",
      "years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical\r\n",
      "instruments, which procured me great esteem and admiration at the\r\n",

      "happened that protracted my stay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the phenomena which had peculiarly attracted my attention was\r\n",
      "the structure of the human frame, and, indeed, any animal endued with\r\n",
      "life.  Whence, I often asked myself, did the principle of life proceed?\r\n",
      "It was a bold question, and one which has ever been considered as a\r\n",
      "mystery; yet with how many things are we upon the brink of becoming\r\n",
      "acquainted, if cowardice or carelessness did not restrain our\r\n",
      "inquiries.  I revolved these circumstances in my mind and determined\r\n",
      "thenceforth to apply myself more particularly to those branches of\r\n",
      "natural philosophy which relate to physiology.  Unless I had been\r\n",
      "animated by an almost supernatural enthusiasm, my application to this\r\n",
      "study would have been irksome and almost intolerable.  To examine the\r\n",
      "causes of life, we must first have recourse to death.  I became\r\n",
      "acquainted with the science of anatomy, but this was not sufficient; I\r\n",
      "must also observe the natural decay and corruption of the human body.\r\n",
      "In my education my father had taken the greatest precautions that my\r\n",
      "mind should be impressed with no supernatural horrors.  I do not ever\r\n",

      "the apparition of a spirit.  Darkness had no effect upon my fancy, and\r\n",

      "towards the object of my search than to exhibit that object already\r\n",
      "accomplished.  I was like the Arabian who had been buried with the dead\r\n",

      "ineffectual light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "imperfect, yet when I considered the improvement which every day takes\r\n",

      "attempts would at least lay the foundations of future success.  Nor\r\n",
      "could I consider the magnitude and complexity of my plan as any\r\n",
      "argument of its impracticability.  It was with these feelings that I\r\n",
      "began the creation of a human being.  As the minuteness of the parts\r\n",
      "formed a great hindrance to my speed, I resolved, contrary to my first\r\n",
      "intention, to make the being of a gigantic stature, that is to say,\r\n",
      "about eight feet in height, and proportionably large.  After having\r\n",
      "formed this determination and having spent some months in successfully\r\n",
      "collecting and arranging my materials, I began.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No one can conceive the variety of feelings which bore me onwards, like\r\n",
      "a hurricane, in the first enthusiasm of success.  Life and death\r\n",
      "appeared to me ideal bounds, which I should first break through, and\r\n",
      "pour a torrent of light into our dark world.  A new species would bless\r\n",
      "me as its creator and source; many happy and excellent natures would\r\n",
      "owe their being to me.  No father could claim the gratitude of his\r\n",
      "child so completely as I should deserve theirs.  Pursuing these\r\n",
      "reflections, I thought that if I could bestow animation upon lifeless\r\n",
      "matter, I might in process of time (although I now found it impossible)\r\n",
      "renew life where death had apparently devoted the body to corruption.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These thoughts supported my spirits, while I pursued my undertaking\r\n",
      "with unremitting ardour.  My cheek had grown pale with study, and my\r\n",
      "person had become emaciated with confinement.  Sometimes, on the very\r\n",
      "brink of certainty, I failed; yet still I clung to the hope which the\r\n",
      "next day or the next hour might realise.  One secret which I alone\r\n",
      "possessed was the hope to which I had dedicated myself; and the moon\r\n",
      "gazed on my midnight labours, while, with unrelaxed and breathless\r\n",
      "eagerness, I pursued nature to her hiding-places.  Who shall conceive\r\n",
      "the horrors of my secret toil as I dabbled among the unhallowed damps\r\n",
      "of the grave or tortured the living animal to animate the lifeless\r\n",
      "clay?  My limbs now tremble, and my eyes swim with the remembrance; but\r\n",
      "then a resistless and almost frantic impulse urged me forward; I seemed\r\n",
      "to have lost all soul or sensation but for this one pursuit.  It was\r\n",
      "indeed but a passing trance, that only made me feel with renewed\r\n",
      "acuteness so soon as, the unnatural stimulus ceasing to operate, I had\r\n",
      "returned to my old habits.  I collected bones from charnel-houses and\r\n",
      "disturbed, with profane fingers, the tremendous secrets of the human\r\n",
      "frame.  In a solitary chamber, or rather cell, at the top of the house,\r\n",
      "and separated from all the other apartments by a gallery and staircase,\r\n",
      "I kept my workshop of filthy creation; my eyeballs were starting from\r\n",
      "their sockets in attending to the details of my employment.  The\r\n",
      "dissecting room and the slaughter-house furnished many of my materials;\r\n",
      "and often did my human nature turn with loathing from my occupation,\r\n",
      "whilst, still urged on by an eagerness which perpetually increased, I\r\n",
      "brought my work near to a conclusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The summer months passed while I was thus engaged, heart and soul, in\r\n",
      "one pursuit.  It was a most beautiful season; never did the fields\r\n",
      "bestow a more plentiful harvest or the vines yield a more luxuriant\r\n",
      "vintage, but my eyes were insensible to the charms of nature.  And the\r\n",
      "same feelings which made me neglect the scenes around me caused me also\r\n",
      "to forget those friends who were so many miles absent, and whom I had\r\n",
      "not seen for so long a time.  I knew my silence disquieted them, and I\r\n",
      "well remembered the words of my father:  âI know that while you are\r\n",
      "pleased with yourself you will think of us with affection, and we shall\r\n",
      "hear regularly from you.  You must pardon me if I regard any\r\n",

      "are equally neglected.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I knew well therefore what would be my fatherâs feelings, but I could\r\n",
      "not tear my thoughts from my employment, loathsome in itself, but which\r\n",
      "had taken an irresistible hold of my imagination.  I wished, as it\r\n",
      "were, to procrastinate all that related to my feelings of affection\r\n",
      "until the great object, which swallowed up every habit of my nature,\r\n",
      "should be completed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I then thought that my father would be unjust if he ascribed my neglect\r\n",
      "to vice or faultiness on my part, but I am now convinced that he was\r\n",
      "justified in conceiving that I should not be altogether free from\r\n",
      "blame.  A human being in perfection ought always to preserve a calm and\r\n",
      "peaceful mind and never to allow passion or a transitory desire to\r\n",
      "disturb his tranquillity.  I do not think that the pursuit of knowledge\r\n",
      "is an exception to this rule.  If the study to which you apply yourself\r\n",
      "has a tendency to weaken your affections and to destroy your taste for\r\n",
      "those simple pleasures in which no alloy can possibly mix, then that\r\n",
      "study is certainly unlawful, that is to say, not befitting the human\r\n",
      "mind.  If this rule were always observed; if no man allowed any pursuit\r\n",

      "The different accidents of life are not so changeable as the feelings\r\n",

      "rushed out of the room and continued a long time traversing my\r\n",
      "bed-chamber, unable to compose my mind to sleep.  At length lassitude\r\n",
      "succeeded to the tumult I had before endured, and I threw myself on the\r\n",

      "But it was in vain; I slept, indeed, but I was disturbed by the wildest\r\n",

      "I started from my sleep with horror; a cold dew covered my forehead, my\r\n",
      "teeth chattered, and every limb became convulsed; when, by the dim and\r\n",
      "yellow light of the moon, as it forced its way through the window\r\n",
      "shutters, I beheld the wretchâthe miserable monster whom I had\r\n",
      "created.  He held up the curtain of the bed; and his eyes, if eyes they\r\n",
      "may be called, were fixed on me.  His jaws opened, and he muttered some\r\n",
      "inarticulate sounds, while a grin wrinkled his cheeks.  He might have\r\n",
      "spoken, but I did not hear; one hand was stretched out, seemingly to\r\n",
      "detain me, but I escaped and rushed downstairs.  I took refuge in the\r\n",

      "lock of the door before I recollected myself.  I then paused, and a\r\n",
      "cold shivering came over me.  I threw the door forcibly open, as\r\n",
      "children are accustomed to do when they expect a spectre to stand in\r\n",
      "waiting for them on the other side; but nothing appeared.  I stepped\r\n",
      "fearfully in:  the apartment was empty, and my bedroom was also freed\r\n",
      "from its hideous guest.  I could hardly believe that so great a good\r\n",
      "fortune could have befallen me, but when I became assured that my enemy\r\n",
      "had indeed fled, I clapped my hands for joy and ran down to Clerval.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We ascended into my room, and the servant presently brought breakfast;\r\n",
      "but I was unable to contain myself.  It was not joy only that possessed\r\n",
      "me; I felt my flesh tingle with excess of sensitiveness, and my pulse\r\n",
      "beat rapidly.  I was unable to remain for a single instant in the same\r\n",
      "place; I jumped over the chairs, clapped my hands, and laughed aloud.\r\n",
      "Clerval at first attributed my unusual spirits to joy on his arrival,\r\n",
      "but when he observed me more attentively, he saw a wildness in my eyes\r\n",
      "for which he could not account, and my loud, unrestrained, heartless\r\n",
      "laughter frightened and astonished him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMy dear Victor,â cried he, âwhat, for Godâs sake,\r\n",
      "is the matter?  Do not laugh in that manner.  How ill you are!  What is the\r\n",
      "cause of all this?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDo not ask me,â cried I, putting my hands before my eyes, for I\r\n",
      "thought I saw the dreaded spectre glide into the room; â_he_ can\r\n",
      "tell. Oh, save me!  Save me!â  I imagined that the monster seized me;\r\n",
      "I struggled furiously and fell down in a fit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Poor Clerval!  What must have been his feelings?  A meeting, which he\r\n",
      "anticipated with such joy, so strangely turned to bitterness.  But I\r\n",
      "was not the witness of his grief, for I was lifeless and did not\r\n",
      "recover my senses for a long, long time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This was the commencement of a nervous fever which confined me for\r\n",
      "several months.  During all that time Henry was my only nurse.  I\r\n",
      "afterwards learned that, knowing my fatherâs advanced age and unfitness\r\n",
      "for so long a journey, and how wretched my sickness would make\r\n",
      "Elizabeth, he spared them this grief by concealing the extent of my\r\n",
      "disorder.  He knew that I could not have a more kind and attentive\r\n",
      "nurse than himself; and, firm in the hope he felt of my recovery, he\r\n",
      "did not doubt that, instead of doing harm, he performed the kindest\r\n",
      "action that he could towards them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I was in reality very ill, and surely nothing but the unbounded and\r\n",
      "unremitting attentions of my friend could have restored me to life.\r\n",
      "The form of the monster on whom I had bestowed existence was for ever\r\n",
      "before my eyes, and I raved incessantly concerning him.  Doubtless my\r\n",
      "words surprised Henry; he at first believed them to be the wanderings\r\n",
      "of my disturbed imagination, but the pertinacity with which I\r\n",
      "continually recurred to the same subject persuaded him that my disorder\r\n",
      "indeed owed its origin to some uncommon and terrible event.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By very slow degrees, and with frequent relapses that alarmed and\r\n",
      "grieved my friend, I recovered.  I remember the first time I became\r\n",
      "capable of observing outward objects with any kind of pleasure, I\r\n",
      "perceived that the fallen leaves had disappeared and that the young\r\n",
      "buds were shooting forth from the trees that shaded my window.  It was\r\n",
      "a divine spring, and the season contributed greatly to my\r\n",
      "convalescence.  I felt also sentiments of joy and affection revive in\r\n",
      "my bosom; my gloom disappeared, and in a short time I became as\r\n",
      "cheerful as before I was attacked by the fatal passion.\r\n",

      "change has taken place in our little household.  Do you remember on\r\n",
      "what occasion Justine Moritz entered our family?  Probably you do not;\r\n",
      "I will relate her history, therefore in a few words.  Madame Moritz,\r\n",
      "her mother, was a widow with four children, of whom Justine was the\r\n",
      "third.  This girl had always been the favourite of her father, but\r\n",
      "through a strange perversity, her mother could not endure her, and\r\n",
      "after the death of M. Moritz, treated her very ill.  My aunt observed\r\n",
      "this, and when Justine was twelve years of age, prevailed on her mother\r\n",
      "to allow her to live at our house.  The republican institutions of our\r\n",
      "country have produced simpler and happier manners than those which\r\n",
      "prevail in the great monarchies that surround it.  Hence there is less\r\n",
      "distinction between the several classes of its inhabitants; and the\r\n",
      "lower orders, being neither so poor nor so despised, their manners are\r\n",
      "more refined and moral.  A servant in Geneva does not mean the same\r\n",
      "thing as a servant in France and England.  Justine, thus received in\r\n",
      "our family, learned the duties of a servant, a condition which, in our\r\n",
      "fortunate country, does not include the idea of ignorance and a\r\n",
      "sacrifice of the dignity of a human being.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âJustine, you may remember, was a great favourite of yours; and I\r\n",
      "recollect you once remarked that if you were in an ill humour, one\r\n",
      "glance from Justine could dissipate it, for the same reason that\r\n",
      "Ariosto gives concerning the beauty of Angelicaâshe looked so\r\n",
      "frank-hearted and happy.  My aunt conceived a great attachment for her,\r\n",
      "by which she was induced to give her an education superior to that\r\n",
      "which she had at first intended.  This benefit was fully repaid;\r\n",
      "Justine was the most grateful little creature in the world:  I do not\r\n",
      "mean that she made any professions I never heard one pass her lips, but\r\n",
      "you could see by her eyes that she almost adored her protectress.\r\n",
      "Although her disposition was gay and in many respects inconsiderate,\r\n",
      "yet she paid the greatest attention to every gesture of my aunt.  She\r\n",
      "thought her the model of all excellence and endeavoured to imitate her\r\n",
      "phraseology and manners, so that even now she often reminds me of her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhen my dearest aunt died every one was too much occupied in their own\r\n",
      "grief to notice poor Justine, who had attended her during her illness\r\n",
      "with the most anxious affection.  Poor Justine was very ill; but other\r\n",
      "trials were reserved for her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOne by one, her brothers and sister died; and her mother, with the\r\n",
      "exception of her neglected daughter, was left childless.  The\r\n",
      "conscience of the woman was troubled; she began to think that the\r\n",
      "deaths of her favourites was a judgement from heaven to chastise her\r\n",
      "partiality.  She was a Roman Catholic; and I believe her confessor\r\n",
      "confirmed the idea which she had conceived.  Accordingly, a few months\r\n",
      "after your departure for Ingolstadt, Justine was called home by her\r\n",
      "repentant mother.  Poor girl!  She wept when she quitted our house; she\r\n",
      "was much altered since the death of my aunt; grief had given softness\r\n",
      "and a winning mildness to her manners, which had before been remarkable\r\n",
      "for vivacity.  Nor was her residence at her motherâs house of a nature\r\n",
      "to restore her gaiety.  The poor woman was very vacillating in her\r\n",
      "repentance.  She sometimes begged Justine to forgive her unkindness,\r\n",
      "but much oftener accused her of having caused the deaths of her\r\n",
      "brothers and sister.  Perpetual fretting at length threw Madame Moritz\r\n",
      "into a decline, which at first increased her irritability, but she is\r\n",
      "now at peace for ever.  She died on the first approach of cold weather,\r\n",
      "at the beginning of this last winter.  Justine has just returned to us;\r\n",
      "and I assure you I love her tenderly.  She is very clever and gentle,\r\n",
      "and extremely pretty; as I mentioned before, her mien and her\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "several professors of the university.  In doing this, I underwent a\r\n",
      "kind of rough usage, ill befitting the wounds that my mind had\r\n",
      "sustained.  Ever since the fatal night, the end of my labours, and the\r\n",
      "beginning of my misfortunes, I had conceived a violent antipathy even\r\n",
      "to the name of natural philosophy.  When I was otherwise quite restored\r\n",
      "to health, the sight of a chemical instrument would renew all the agony\r\n",
      "of my nervous symptoms.  Henry saw this, and had removed all my\r\n",

      "perceived that I had acquired a dislike for the room which had\r\n",
      "previously been my laboratory.  But these cares of Clerval were made of\r\n",
      "no avail when I visited the professors.  M. Waldman inflicted torture\r\n",
      "when he praised, with kindness and warmth, the astonishing progress I\r\n",
      "had made in the sciences.  He soon perceived that I disliked the\r\n",

      "modesty, and changed the subject from my improvement, to the science\r\n",
      "itself, with a desire, as I evidently saw, of drawing me out.  What\r\n",
      "could I do?  He meant to please, and he tormented me.  I felt as if he\r\n",
      "had placed carefully, one by one, in my view those instruments which\r\n",

      "master of the oriental languages, and thus he should open a field for\r\n",
      "the plan of life he had marked out for himself.  Resolved to pursue no\r\n",
      "inglorious career, he turned his eyes toward the East, as affording\r\n",
      "scope for his spirit of enterprise.  The Persian, Arabic, and Sanskrit\r\n",
      "languages engaged his attention, and I was easily induced to enter on\r\n",
      "the same studies.  Idleness had ever been irksome to me, and now that I\r\n",
      "wished to fly from reflection, and hated my former studies, I felt\r\n",
      "great relief in being the fellow-pupil with my friend, and found not\r\n",
      "only instruction but consolation in the works of the orientalists.  I\r\n",
      "did not, like him, attempt a critical knowledge of their dialects, for\r\n",
      "I did not contemplate making any other use of them than temporary\r\n",
      "amusement.  I read merely to understand their meaning, and they well\r\n",
      "repaid my labours.  Their melancholy is soothing, and their joy\r\n",
      "elevating, to a degree I never experienced in studying the authors of\r\n",
      "any other country.  When you read their writings, life appears to\r\n",
      "consist in a warm sun and a garden of roses,âin the smiles and frowns\r\n",
      "of a fair enemy, and the fire that consumes your own heart.  How\r\n",

      "and my journey was retarded until the ensuing spring.  I felt this\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "happiness, and I think of them with pleasure.  My country, my beloved\r\n",
      "country! who but a native can tell the delight I took in again\r\n",
      "beholding thy streams, thy mountains, and, more than all, thy lovely\r\n",

      "closed around; and when I could hardly see the dark mountains, I felt still\r\n",
      "more gloomily. The picture appeared a vast and dim scene of evil, and I\r\n",
      "foresaw obscurely that I was destined to become the most wretched of human\r\n",
      "beings. Alas! I prophesied truly, and failed only in one single\r\n",
      "circumstance, that in all the misery I imagined and dreaded, I did not\r\n",
      "conceive the hundredth part of the anguish I was destined to endure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was completely dark when I arrived in the environs of Geneva; the gates\r\n",
      "of the town were already shut; and I was obliged to pass the night at\r\n",
      "Secheron, a village at the distance of half a league from the city. The sky\r\n",
      "was serene; and, as I was unable to rest, I resolved to visit the spot\r\n",
      "where my poor William had been murdered. As I could not pass through the\r\n",
      "town, I was obliged to cross the lake in a boat to arrive at Plainpalais.\r\n",
      "During this short voyage I saw the lightning playing on the summit of Mont\r\n",
      "Blanc in the most beautiful figures. The storm appeared to approach\r\n",
      "rapidly, and, on landing, I ascended a low hill, that I might observe its\r\n",
      "progress. It advanced; the heavens were clouded, and I soon felt the rain\r\n",
      "coming slowly in large drops, but its violence quickly increased.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I quitted my seat, and walked on, although the darkness and storm\r\n",
      "increased every minute, and the thunder burst with a terrific crash\r\n",
      "over my head.  It was echoed from SalÃªve, the Juras, and the Alps of\r\n",
      "Savoy; vivid flashes of lightning dazzled my eyes, illuminating the\r\n",
      "lake, making it appear like a vast sheet of fire; then for an instant\r\n",
      "every thing seemed of a pitchy darkness, until the eye recovered itself\r\n",
      "from the preceding flash.  The storm, as is often the case in\r\n",
      "Switzerland, appeared at once in various parts of the heavens. The\r\n",
      "most violent storm hung exactly north of the town, over the part of the\r\n",
      "lake which lies between the promontory of Belrive and the village of\r\n",
      "CopÃªt. Another storm enlightened Jura with faint flashes; and another\r\n",
      "darkened and sometimes disclosed the MÃ´le, a peaked mountain to the\r\n",
      "east of the lake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While I watched the tempest, so beautiful yet terrific, I wandered on with\r\n",
      "a hasty step. This noble war in the sky elevated my spirits; I clasped my\r\n",
      "hands, and exclaimed aloud, âWilliam, dear angel! this is thy\r\n",
      "funeral, this thy dirge!â As I said these words, I perceived in the\r\n",
      "gloom a figure which stole from behind a clump of trees near me; I stood\r\n",
      "fixed, gazing intently: I could not be mistaken. A flash of lightning\r\n",
      "illuminated the object, and discovered its shape plainly to me; its\r\n",
      "gigantic stature, and the deformity of its aspect more hideous than belongs\r\n",
      "to humanity, instantly informed me that it was the wretch, the filthy\r\n",
      "dÃ¦mon, to whom I had given life. What did he there? Could he be (I\r\n",
      "shuddered at the conception) the murderer of my brother? No sooner did that\r\n",
      "idea cross my imagination, than I became convinced of its truth; my teeth\r\n",
      "chattered, and I was forced to lean against a tree for support. The figure\r\n",
      "passed me quickly, and I lost it in the gloom. Nothing in human shape could\r\n",
      "have destroyed the fair child. _He_ was the murderer! I could not\r\n",
      "doubt it. The mere presence of the idea was an irresistible proof of the\r\n",
      "fact. I thought of pursuing the devil; but it would have been in vain, for\r\n",
      "another flash discovered him to me hanging among the rocks of the nearly\r\n",
      "perpendicular ascent of Mont SalÃªve, a hill that bounds Plainpalais on the\r\n",
      "south. He soon reached the summit, and disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I remained motionless.  The thunder ceased; but the rain still\r\n",
      "continued, and the scene was enveloped in an impenetrable darkness.  I\r\n",
      "revolved in my mind the events which I had until now sought to forget:\r\n",
      "the whole train of my progress toward the creation; the appearance of\r\n",
      "the works of my own hands at my bedside; its departure.  Two years had\r\n",
      "now nearly elapsed since the night on which he first received life; and\r\n",
      "was this his first crime?  Alas!  I had turned loose into the world a\r\n",
      "depraved wretch, whose delight was in carnage and misery; had he not\r\n",
      "murdered my brother?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "No one can conceive the anguish I suffered during the remainder of the\r\n",
      "night, which I spent, cold and wet, in the open air.  But I did not\r\n",
      "feel the inconvenience of the weather; my imagination was busy in\r\n",
      "scenes of evil and despair.  I considered the being whom I had cast\r\n",
      "among mankind, and endowed with the will and power to effect purposes\r\n",
      "of horror, such as the deed which he had now done, nearly in the light\r\n",
      "of my own vampire, my own spirit let loose from the grave, and forced\r\n",
      "to destroy all that was dear to me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Day dawned; and I directed my steps towards the town.  The gates were\r\n",
      "open, and I hastened to my fatherâs house.  My first thought was to\r\n",
      "discover what I knew of the murderer, and cause instant pursuit to be\r\n",
      "made.  But I paused when I reflected on the story that I had to tell. A\r\n",
      "being whom I myself had formed, and endued with life, had met me at\r\n",
      "midnight among the precipices of an inaccessible mountain.  I\r\n",
      "remembered also the nervous fever with which I had been seized just at\r\n",
      "the time that I dated my creation, and which would give an air of\r\n",
      "delirium to a tale otherwise so utterly improbable.  I well knew that\r\n",
      "if any other had communicated such a relation to me, I should have\r\n",
      "looked upon it as the ravings of insanity.  Besides, the strange nature\r\n",
      "of the animal would elude all pursuit, even if I were so far credited\r\n",
      "as to persuade my relatives to commence it.  And then of what use would\r\n",
      "be pursuit?  Who could arrest a creature capable of scaling the\r\n",
      "overhanging sides of Mont SalÃªve?  These reflections determined me, and\r\n",
      "I resolved to remain silent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was about five in the morning when I entered my fatherâs house.  I\r\n",
      "told the servants not to disturb the family, and went into the library\r\n",
      "to attend their usual hour of rising.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Six years had elapsed, passed in a dream but for one indelible trace, and I\r\n",
      "stood in the same place where I had last embraced my father before my\r\n",
      "departure for Ingolstadt. Beloved and venerable parent! He still remained\r\n",
      "to me. I gazed on the picture of my mother, which stood over the\r\n",
      "mantel-piece. It was an historical subject, painted at my fatherâs\r\n",
      "desire, and represented Caroline Beaufort in an agony of despair, kneeling\r\n",
      "by the coffin of her dead father. Her garb was rustic, and her cheek pale;\r\n",
      "but there was an air of dignity and beauty, that hardly permitted the\r\n",
      "sentiment of pity. Below this picture was a miniature of William; and my\r\n",
      "tears flowed when I looked upon it. While I was thus engaged, Ernest\r\n",
      "entered: he had heard me arrive, and hastened to welcome me:\r\n",
      "âWelcome, my dearest Victor,â said he. âAh! I wish you\r\n",
      "had come three months ago, and then you would have found us all joyous and\r\n",
      "delighted. You come to us now to share a misery which nothing can\r\n",
      "alleviate; yet your presence will, I hope, revive our father, who seems\r\n",
      "sinking under his misfortune; and your persuasions will induce poor\r\n",
      "Elizabeth to cease her vain and tormenting self-accusations.âPoor\r\n",
      "William! he was our darling and our pride!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Tears, unrestrained, fell from my brotherâs eyes; a sense of mortal\r\n",
      "agony crept over my frame.  Before, I had only imagined the\r\n",
      "wretchedness of my desolated home; the reality came on me as a new, and\r\n",
      "a not less terrible, disaster.  I tried to calm Ernest; I enquired more\r\n",
      "minutely concerning my father, and here I named my cousin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âShe most of all,â said Ernest, ârequires consolation; she accused\r\n",
      "herself of having caused the death of my brother, and that made her\r\n",
      "very wretched.  But since the murderer has been discoveredââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe murderer discovered!  Good God! how can that be? who could attempt\r\n",
      "to pursue him?  It is impossible; one might as well try to overtake the\r\n",
      "winds, or confine a mountain-stream with a straw.  I saw him too; he\r\n",

      "towards the valley of Chamounix.  I had visited it frequently during my\r\n",

      "middle of the month of August, nearly two months after the death of\r\n",
      "Justine, that miserable epoch from which I dated all my woe.  The\r\n",
      "weight upon my spirit was sensibly lightened as I plunged yet deeper in\r\n",
      "the ravine of Arve.  The immense mountains and precipices that overhung\r\n",

      "the dashing of the waterfalls around spoke of a power mighty as\r\n",
      "Omnipotenceâand I ceased to fear or to bend before any being less\r\n",
      "almighty than that which had created and ruled the elements, here\r\n",
      "displayed in their most terrific guise.  Still, as I ascended higher,\r\n",

      "Ruined castles hanging on the precipices of piny mountains, the\r\n",
      "impetuous Arve, and cottages every here and there peeping forth from\r\n",

      "forms, opened before me, and I began to ascend the mountain that\r\n",
      "overhangs it.  Soon after, I entered the valley of Chamounix.  This\r\n",
      "valley is more wonderful and sublime, but not so beautiful and\r\n",
      "picturesque as that of Servox, through which I had just passed.  The\r\n",
      "high and snowy mountains were its immediate boundaries, but I saw no\r\n",
      "more ruined castles and fertile fields.  Immense glaciers approached\r\n",
      "the road; I heard the rumbling thunder of the falling avalanche and\r\n",
      "marked the smoke of its passage.  Mont Blanc, the supreme and\r\n",
      "magnificent Mont Blanc, raised itself from the surrounding _aiguilles_,\r\n",
      "and its tremendous _dÃ´me_ overlooked the valley.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A tingling long-lost sense of pleasure often came across me during this\r\n",
      "journey.  Some turn in the road, some new object suddenly perceived and\r\n",
      "recognised, reminded me of days gone by, and were associated with the\r\n",
      "lighthearted gaiety of boyhood.  The very winds whispered in soothing\r\n",
      "accents, and maternal Nature bade me weep no more.  Then again the\r\n",
      "kindly influence ceased to actâI found myself fettered again to grief\r\n",
      "and indulging in all the misery of reflection.  Then I spurred on my\r\n",
      "animal, striving so to forget the world, my fears, and more than all,\r\n",
      "myselfâor, in a more desperate fashion, I alighted and threw myself on\r\n",
      "the grass, weighed down by horror and despair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At length I arrived at the village of Chamounix.  Exhaustion succeeded\r\n",

      "lightnings that played above Mont Blanc and listening to the rushing of\r\n",
      "the Arve, which pursued its noisy way beneath.  The same lulling sounds\r\n",
      "acted as a lullaby to my too keen sensations; when I placed my head\r\n",

      "shelter; at length I perceived a small hut, on a rising ground, which\r\n",
      "had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.  This\r\n",
      "was a new sight to me, and I examined the structure with great\r\n",
      "curiosity.  Finding the door open, I entered.  An old man sat in it,\r\n",
      "near a fire, over which he was preparing his breakfast.  He turned on\r\n",
      "hearing a noise, and perceiving me, shrieked loudly, and quitting the\r\n",
      "hut, ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form\r\n",
      "hardly appeared capable.  His appearance, different from any I had ever\r\n",
      "before seen, and his flight somewhat surprised me.  But I was enchanted\r\n",
      "by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not\r\n",
      "penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite\r\n",
      "and divine a retreat as PandÃ¦monium appeared to the dÃ¦mons of hell\r\n",
      "after their sufferings in the lake of fire.  I greedily devoured the\r\n",
      "remnants of the shepherdâs breakfast, which consisted of bread, cheese,\r\n",
      "milk, and wine; the latter, however, I did not like.  Then, overcome by\r\n",
      "fatigue, I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt was noon when I awoke, and allured by the warmth of the sun, which\r\n",
      "shone brightly on the white ground, I determined to recommence my\r\n",
      "travels; and, depositing the remains of the peasantâs breakfast in a\r\n",
      "wallet I found, I proceeded across the fields for several hours, until\r\n",
      "at sunset I arrived at a village.  How miraculous did this appear!  The\r\n",
      "huts, the neater cottages, and stately houses engaged my admiration by\r\n",
      "turns.  The vegetables in the gardens, the milk and cheese that I saw\r\n",
      "placed at the windows of some of the cottages, allured my appetite. One\r\n",
      "of the best of these I entered, but I had hardly placed my foot within\r\n",
      "the door before the children shrieked, and one of the women fainted.\r\n",
      "The whole village was roused; some fled, some attacked me, until,\r\n",
      "grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons, I\r\n",
      "escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel,\r\n",
      "quite bare, and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had\r\n",
      "beheld in the village.  This hovel however, joined a cottage of a neat\r\n",
      "and pleasant appearance, but after my late dearly bought experience, I\r\n",
      "dared not enter it.  My place of refuge was constructed of wood, but so\r\n",
      "low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.  No wood, however,\r\n",
      "was placed on the earth, which formed the floor, but it was dry; and\r\n",
      "although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks, I found it an\r\n",
      "agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHere, then, I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter,\r\n",
      "however miserable, from the inclemency of the season, and still more\r\n",
      "from the barbarity of man.  As soon as morning dawned I crept from my\r\n",
      "kennel, that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could\r\n",
      "remain in the habitation I had found.  It was situated against the back\r\n",
      "of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig\r\n",
      "sty and a clear pool of water.  One part was open, and by that I had\r\n",
      "crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived\r\n",
      "with stones and wood, yet in such a manner that I might move them on\r\n",
      "occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty, and\r\n",

      "retired, for I saw the figure of a man at a distance, and I remembered\r\n",
      "too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.  I\r\n",
      "had first, however, provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf\r\n",
      "of coarse bread, which I purloined, and a cup with which I could drink\r\n",
      "more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by\r\n",
      "my retreat.  The floor was a little raised, so that it was kept\r\n",
      "perfectly dry, and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was\r\n",
      "tolerably warm.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBeing thus provided, I resolved to reside in this hovel until\r\n",
      "something should occur which might alter my determination.  It was\r\n",
      "indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest, my former residence,\r\n",
      "the rain-dropping branches, and dank earth.  I ate my breakfast with\r\n",
      "pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little\r\n",
      "water when I heard a step, and looking through a small chink, I beheld\r\n",
      "a young creature, with a pail on her head, passing before my hovel. The\r\n",
      "girl was young and of gentle demeanour, unlike what I have since found\r\n",
      "cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.  Yet she was meanly dressed, a\r\n",
      "coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair\r\n",
      "hair was plaited but not adorned:  she looked patient yet sad.  I lost\r\n",
      "sight of her, and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing\r\n",
      "the pail, which was now partly filled with milk.  As she walked along,\r\n",
      "seemingly incommoded by the burden, a young man met her, whose\r\n",
      "countenance expressed a deeper despondence.  Uttering a few sounds with\r\n",
      "an air of melancholy, he took the pail from her head and bore it to the\r\n",
      "cottage himself.  She followed, and they disappeared.  Presently I saw\r\n",
      "the young man again, with some tools in his hand, cross the field\r\n",
      "behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied, sometimes in the\r\n",
      "house and sometimes in the yard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOn examining my dwelling, I found that one of the windows of the\r\n",
      "cottage had formerly occupied a part of it, but the panes had been\r\n",
      "filled up with wood. In one of these was a small and almost\r\n",
      "imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.\r\n",
      "Through this crevice a small room was visible, whitewashed and clean\r\n",
      "but very bare of furniture. In one corner, near a small fire, sat an\r\n",
      "old man, leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude. The\r\n",
      "young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she\r\n",
      "took something out of a drawer, which employed her hands, and she sat\r\n",
      "down beside the old man, who, taking up an instrument, began to play\r\n",
      "and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the\r\n",
      "nightingale. It was a lovely sight, even to me, poor wretch who had\r\n",
      "never beheld aught beautiful before. The silver hair and benevolent\r\n",
      "countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence, while the gentle\r\n",
      "manners of the girl enticed my love. He played a sweet mournful air\r\n",
      "which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion, of\r\n",
      "which the old man took no notice, until she sobbed audibly; he then\r\n",
      "pronounced a few sounds, and the fair creature, leaving her work, knelt\r\n",
      "at his feet. He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection\r\n",
      "that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were\r\n",
      "a mixture of pain and pleasure, such as I had never before experienced,\r\n",
      "either from hunger or cold, warmth or food; and I withdrew from the\r\n",
      "window, unable to bear these emotions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSoon after this the young man returned, bearing on his shoulders a\r\n",
      "load of wood.  The girl met him at the door, helped to relieve him of\r\n",
      "his burden, and taking some of the fuel into the cottage, placed it on\r\n",
      "the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage,\r\n",
      "and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.  She seemed\r\n",
      "pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants, which she\r\n",
      "placed in water, and then upon the fire.  She afterwards continued her\r\n",
      "work, whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily\r\n",
      "employed in digging and pulling up roots.  After he had been employed\r\n",

      "cottage together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air, and they sat down to\r\n",

      "occupied in arranging the cottage, the old man walked before the\r\n",
      "cottage in the sun for a few minutes, leaning on the arm of the youth.\r\n",
      "Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent\r\n",
      "creatures.  One was old, with silver hairs and a countenance beaming\r\n",
      "with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his\r\n",
      "figure, and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry, yet his\r\n",
      "eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.  The\r\n",
      "old man returned to the cottage, and the youth, with tools different\r\n",

      "pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.  In the evening\r\n",
      "the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations\r\n",
      "which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the\r\n",
      "instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in\r\n",
      "the morning.  So soon as he had finished, the youth began, not to play,\r\n",
      "but to utter sounds that were monotonous, and neither resembling the\r\n",
      "harmony of the old manâs instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since\r\n",

      "farmer, because he often went forth and did not return until dinner,\r\n",
      "yet brought no wood with him.  At other times he worked in the garden,\r\n",

      "any other being in existence; but his state was far different from mine\r\n",
      "in every other respect.  He had come forth from the hands of God a\r\n",

      "which they were written, I began to study them with diligence.  It was\r\n",
      "your journal of the four months that preceded my creation.  You\r\n",
      "minutely described in these papers every step you took in the progress\r\n",
      "of your work; this history was mingled with accounts of domestic\r\n",

      "from their door one, however monstrous, who solicited their compassion\r\n",
      "and friendship?  I resolved, at least, not to despair, but in every way\r\n",
      "to fit myself for an interview with them which would decide my fate.  I\r\n",

      "spent more time in amusement and conversation, and were assisted in\r\n",

      "discovered to me more clearly what a wretched outcast I was.  I\r\n",
      "cherished hope, it is true, but it vanished when I beheld my person\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "which in a few months I resolved to undergo; and sometimes I allowed my\r\n",
      "thoughts, unchecked by reason, to ramble in the fields of Paradise, and\r\n",
      "dared to fancy amiable and lovely creatures sympathising with my\r\n",

      "smiles of consolation.  But it was all a dream; no Eve soothed my\r\n",

      "clothed my desires under a guise which excited no suspicion, while I\r\n",

      "leave my friends unconscious of the existence of their enemy and\r\n",
      "unprotected from his attacks, exasperated as he might be by my\r\n",

      "would he not accompany me to England?  This imagination was dreadful in\r\n",
      "itself, but soothing inasmuch as it supposed the safety of my friends.\r\n",
      "I was agonised with the idea of the possibility that the reverse of\r\n",
      "this might happen.  But through the whole period during which I was the\r\n",
      "slave of my creature I allowed myself to be governed by the impulses of\r\n",

      "machinations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was in the latter end of September that I again quitted my native\r\n",

      "therefore acquiesced, but she was filled with disquiet at the idea of\r\n",

      "I remembered only, and it was with a bitter anguish that I reflected on\r\n",
      "it, to order that my chemical instruments should be packed to go with\r\n",
      "me.  Filled with dreary imaginations, I passed through many beautiful\r\n",
      "and majestic scenes, but my eyes were fixed and unobserving.  I could\r\n",
      "only think of the bourne of my travels and the work which was to occupy\r\n",
      "me whilst they endured.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After some days spent in listless indolence, during which I traversed\r\n",

      "setting sun, and more happy when he beheld it rise and recommence a new\r\n",
      "day.  He pointed out to me the shifting colours of the landscape and\r\n",
      "the appearances of the sky.  âThis is what it is to live,â he cried;\r\n",
      "ânow I enjoy existence!  But you, my dear Frankenstein, wherefore are\r\n",
      "you desponding and sorrowful!â In truth, I was occupied by gloomy\r\n",
      "thoughts and neither saw the descent of the evening star nor the golden\r\n",
      "sunrise reflected in the Rhine.  And you, my friend, would be far more\r\n",
      "amused with the journal of Clerval, who observed the scenery with an\r\n",
      "eye of feeling and delight, than in listening to my reflections.  I, a\r\n",
      "miserable wretch, haunted by a curse that shut up every avenue to\r\n",
      "enjoyment.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We had agreed to descend the Rhine in a boat from Strasburgh to\r\n",
      "Rotterdam, whence we might take shipping for London.  During this\r\n",
      "voyage we passed many willowy islands and saw several beautiful towns.\r\n",
      "We stayed a day at Mannheim, and on the fifth from our departure from\r\n",
      "Strasburgh, arrived at Mainz.  The course of the Rhine below Mainz\r\n",
      "becomes much more picturesque.  The river descends rapidly and winds\r\n",
      "between hills, not high, but steep, and of beautiful forms.  We saw\r\n",
      "many ruined castles standing on the edges of precipices, surrounded by\r\n",
      "black woods, high and inaccessible.  This part of the Rhine, indeed,\r\n",
      "presents a singularly variegated landscape.  In one spot you view\r\n",
      "rugged hills, ruined castles overlooking tremendous precipices, with\r\n",
      "the dark Rhine rushing beneath; and on the sudden turn of a promontory,\r\n",
      "flourishing vineyards with green sloping banks and a meandering river\r\n",
      "and populous towns occupy the scene.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We travelled at the time of the vintage and heard the song of the labourers\r\n",
      "as we glided down the stream. Even I, depressed in mind, and my spirits\r\n",
      "continually agitated by gloomy feelings, even I was pleased. I lay at the\r\n",
      "bottom of the boat, and as I gazed on the cloudless blue sky, I seemed to\r\n",
      "drink in a tranquillity to which I had long been a stranger. And if these\r\n",
      "were my sensations, who can describe those of Henry? He felt as if he had\r\n",
      "been transported to Fairy-land and enjoyed a happiness seldom tasted by\r\n",
      "man. âI have seen,â he said, âthe most beautiful scenes\r\n",
      "of my own country; I have visited the lakes of Lucerne and Uri, where the\r\n",
      "snowy mountains descend almost perpendicularly to the water, casting black\r\n",
      "and impenetrable shades, which would cause a gloomy and mournful appearance\r\n",
      "were it not for the most verdant islands that relieve the eye by their gay\r\n",
      "appearance; I have seen this lake agitated by a tempest, when the wind tore\r\n",
      "up whirlwinds of water and gave you an idea of what the water-spout must be\r\n",
      "on the great ocean; and the waves dash with fury the base of the mountain,\r\n",
      "where the priest and his mistress were overwhelmed by an avalanche and\r\n",
      "where their dying voices are still said to be heard amid the pauses of the\r\n",
      "nightly wind; I have seen the mountains of La Valais, and the Pays de Vaud;\r\n",
      "but this country, Victor, pleases me more than all those wonders. The\r\n",
      "mountains of Switzerland are more majestic and strange, but there is a\r\n",
      "charm in the banks of this divine river that I never before saw equalled.\r\n",
      "Look at that castle which overhangs yon precipice; and that also on the\r\n",
      "island, almost concealed amongst the foliage of those lovely trees; and now\r\n",
      "that group of labourers coming from among their vines; and that village\r\n",
      "half hid in the recess of the mountain. Oh, surely the spirit that inhabits\r\n",
      "and guards this place has a soul more in harmony with man than those who\r\n",

      "enthusiastic imagination was chastened by the sensibility of his heart. His\r\n",

      "devoted and wondrous nature that the worldly-minded teach us to look for only\r\n",
      "in the imagination. But even human sympathies were not sufficient to\r\n",
      "satisfy his eager mind. The scenery of external nature, which others regard\r\n",
      "only with admiration, he loved with ardour:â\r\n",

      "execution of his plan.  He was for ever busy, and the only check to his\r\n",

      "were often prolonged by the successive objects that presented\r\n",

      "everything is on a lower scale, and the green hills want the crown of\r\n",

      "in his own nature greater capacities and resources than he could have\r\n",
      "imagined himself to have possessed while he associated with his\r\n",

      "The night passed away, and the sun rose from the ocean; my feelings became\r\n",
      "calmer, if it may be called calmness when the violence of rage sinks into\r\n",
      "the depths of despair. I left the house, the horrid scene of the last\r\n",
      "nightâs contention, and walked on the beach of the sea, which I\r\n",
      "almost regarded as an insuperable barrier between me and my fellow\r\n",
      "creatures; nay, a wish that such should prove the fact stole across me. I\r\n",
      "desired that I might pass my life on that barren rock, wearily, it is true,\r\n",
      "but uninterrupted by any sudden shock of misery. If I returned, it was to\r\n",
      "be sacrificed or to see those whom I most loved die under the grasp of a\r\n",
      "dÃ¦mon whom I had myself created.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I walked about the isle like a restless spectre, separated from all it\r\n",
      "loved and miserable in the separation.  When it became noon, and the\r\n",
      "sun rose higher, I lay down on the grass and was overpowered by a deep\r\n",
      "sleep.  I had been awake the whole of the preceding night, my nerves\r\n",
      "were agitated, and my eyes inflamed by watching and misery.  The sleep\r\n",
      "into which I now sank refreshed me; and when I awoke, I again felt as\r\n",
      "if I belonged to a race of human beings like myself, and I began to\r\n",
      "reflect upon what had passed with greater composure; yet still the\r\n",
      "words of the fiend rang in my ears like a death-knell; they appeared\r\n",
      "like a dream, yet distinct and oppressive as a reality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sun had far descended, and I still sat on the shore, satisfying my\r\n",
      "appetite, which had become ravenous, with an oaten cake, when I saw a\r\n",
      "fishing-boat land close to me, and one of the men brought me a packet;\r\n",
      "it contained letters from Geneva, and one from Clerval entreating me to\r\n",
      "join him.  He said that he was wearing away his time fruitlessly where\r\n",
      "he was, that letters from the friends he had formed in London desired\r\n",
      "his return to complete the negotiation they had entered into for his\r\n",
      "Indian enterprise.  He could not any longer delay his departure; but as\r\n",
      "his journey to London might be followed, even sooner than he now\r\n",
      "conjectured, by his longer voyage, he entreated me to bestow as much of\r\n",
      "my society on him as I could spare.  He besought me, therefore, to\r\n",
      "leave my solitary isle and to meet him at Perth, that we might proceed\r\n",
      "southwards together.  This letter in a degree recalled me to life, and\r\n",
      "I determined to quit my island at the expiration of two days.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet, before I departed, there was a task to perform, on which I shuddered\r\n",
      "to reflect; I must pack up my chemical instruments, and for that purpose I\r\n",
      "must enter the room which had been the scene of my odious work, and I must\r\n",
      "handle those utensils the sight of which was sickening to me. The next\r\n",
      "morning, at daybreak, I summoned sufficient courage and unlocked the door\r\n",
      "of my laboratory. The remains of the half-finished creature, whom I had\r\n",
      "destroyed, lay scattered on the floor, and I almost felt as if I had\r\n",
      "mangled the living flesh of a human being. I paused to collect myself and\r\n",
      "then entered the chamber. With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments\r\n",
      "out of the room, but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my\r\n",
      "work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly\r\n",
      "put them into a basket, with a great quantity of stones, and laying them\r\n",
      "up, determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the\r\n",
      "meantime I sat upon the beach, employed in cleaning and arranging my\r\n",
      "chemical apparatus.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place\r\n",
      "in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dÃ¦mon.  I had\r\n",
      "before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that, with\r\n",
      "whatever consequences, must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film\r\n",
      "had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw\r\n",
      "clearly.  The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur\r\n",
      "to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts, but I did not\r\n",
      "reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.  I had resolved in\r\n",
      "my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made\r\n",
      "would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness, and I\r\n",
      "banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different\r\n",
      "conclusion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then, putting my\r\n",
      "basket aboard a little skiff, sailed out about four miles from the shore.\r\n",
      "The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land,\r\n",
      "but I sailed away from them. I felt as if I was about the commission of a\r\n",
      "dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my\r\n",
      "fellow creatures. At one time the moon, which had before been clear, was\r\n",
      "suddenly overspread by a thick cloud, and I took advantage of the moment of\r\n",
      "darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound\r\n",
      "as it sank and then sailed away from the spot. The sky became clouded, but\r\n",
      "the air was pure, although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then\r\n",
      "rising. But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations\r\n",
      "that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water, and fixing the rudder in a\r\n",
      "direct position, stretched myself at the bottom of the boat. Clouds hid the\r\n",
      "moon, everything was obscure, and I heard only the sound of the boat as its\r\n",
      "keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me, and in a short time I\r\n",
      "slept soundly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I do not know how long I remained in this situation, but when I awoke I\r\n",
      "found that the sun had already mounted considerably. The wind was high, and\r\n",
      "the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff. I found\r\n",
      "that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from\r\n",
      "which I had embarked. I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found\r\n",
      "that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with\r\n",
      "water. Thus situated, my only resource was to drive before the wind. I\r\n",
      "confess that I felt a few sensations of terror. I had no compass with me\r\n",
      "and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the\r\n",
      "world that the sun was of little benefit to me. I might be driven into the\r\n",
      "wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in\r\n",
      "the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me. I had already\r\n",
      "been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst, a prelude to\r\n",
      "my other sufferings. I looked on the heavens, which were covered by clouds\r\n",
      "that flew before the wind, only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the\r\n",
      "sea; it was to be my grave. âFiend,â I exclaimed, âyour\r\n",
      "task is already fulfilled!â I thought of Elizabeth, of my father, and\r\n",
      "of Clervalâall left behind, on whom the monster might satisfy his\r\n",
      "sanguinary and merciless passions. This idea plunged me into a reverie so\r\n",
      "despairing and frightful that even now, when the scene is on the point of\r\n",
      "closing before me for ever, I shudder to reflect on it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some hours passed thus; but by degrees, as the sun declined towards the\r\n",
      "horizon, the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became\r\n",
      "free from breakers.  But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick\r\n",
      "and hardly able to hold the rudder, when suddenly I saw a line of high\r\n",
      "land towards the south.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost spent, as I was, by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured\r\n",
      "for several hours, this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of\r\n",
      "warm joy to my heart, and tears gushed from my eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How mutable are our feelings, and how strange is that clinging love we have\r\n",
      "of life even in the excess of misery! I constructed another sail with a\r\n",
      "part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land. It had a\r\n",
      "wild and rocky appearance, but as I approached nearer I easily perceived\r\n",
      "the traces of cultivation. I saw vessels near the shore and found myself\r\n",
      "suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man. I\r\n",
      "carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at\r\n",
      "length saw issuing from behind a small promontory. As I was in a state of\r\n",
      "extreme debility, I resolved to sail directly towards the town, as a place\r\n",
      "where I could most easily procure nourishment. Fortunately I had money with\r\n",
      "me. As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good\r\n",
      "harbour, which I entered, my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected\r\n",
      "escape.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails, several\r\n",
      "people crowded towards the spot.  They seemed much surprised at my\r\n",
      "appearance, but instead of offering me any assistance, whispered\r\n",
      "together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me\r\n",
      "a slight sensation of alarm. As it was, I merely remarked that they\r\n",
      "spoke English, and I therefore addressed them in that language.  âMy\r\n",
      "good friends,â said I, âwill you be so kind as to tell me the name of\r\n",
      "this town and inform me where I am?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou will know that soon enough,â replied a man with a hoarse voice.\r\n",
      "âMaybe you are come to a place that will not prove much to your taste,\r\n",
      "but you will not be consulted as to your quarters, I promise you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a\r\n",
      "stranger, and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and\r\n",
      "angry countenances of his companions.  âWhy do you answer me so\r\n",
      "roughly?â  I replied.  âSurely it is not the custom of Englishmen to\r\n",
      "receive strangers so inhospitably.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI do not know,â said the man, âwhat the custom of the\r\n",
      "English may be, but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While this strange dialogue continued, I perceived the crowd rapidly\r\n",
      "increase. Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger, which\r\n",
      "annoyed and in some degree alarmed me. I inquired the way to the inn, but\r\n",
      "no one replied. I then moved forward, and a murmuring sound arose from the\r\n",
      "crowd as they followed and surrounded me, when an ill-looking man\r\n",
      "approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said, âCome, sir, you must\r\n",
      "follow me to Mr. Kirwinâs to give an account of yourself.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWho is Mr. Kirwin?  Why am I to give an account of myself?  Is not\r\n",
      "this a free country?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAy, sir, free enough for honest folks.  Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate,\r\n",
      "and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was\r\n",
      "found murdered here last night.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This answer startled me, but I presently recovered myself. I was innocent;\r\n",
      "that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence\r\n",
      "and was led to one of the best houses in the town. I was ready to sink from\r\n",
      "fatigue and hunger, but being surrounded by a crowd, I thought it politic\r\n",
      "to rouse all my strength, that no physical debility might be construed into\r\n",
      "apprehension or conscious guilt. Little did I then expect the calamity that\r\n",
      "was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair\r\n",
      "all fear of ignominy or death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I must pause here, for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of\r\n",

      "I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate, an old\r\n",
      "benevolent man with calm and mild manners.  He looked upon me, however,\r\n",
      "with some degree of severity, and then, turning towards my conductors,\r\n",
      "he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "About half a dozen men came forward; and, one being selected by the\r\n",
      "magistrate, he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with\r\n",
      "his son and brother-in-law, Daniel Nugent, when, about ten oâclock,\r\n",
      "they observed a strong northerly blast rising, and they accordingly put in\r\n",
      "for port. It was a very dark night, as the moon had not yet risen; they did\r\n",
      "not land at the harbour, but, as they had been accustomed, at a creek about\r\n",
      "two miles below. He walked on first, carrying a part of the fishing tackle,\r\n",
      "and his companions followed him at some distance. As he was proceeding\r\n",
      "along the sands, he struck his foot against something and fell at his\r\n",
      "length on the ground. His companions came up to assist him, and by the\r\n",
      "light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man,\r\n",
      "who was to all appearance dead. Their first supposition was that it was the\r\n",
      "corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the\r\n",
      "waves, but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even\r\n",
      "that the body was not then cold. They instantly carried it to the cottage\r\n",
      "of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured, but in vain, to restore it\r\n",
      "to life. It appeared to be a handsome young man, about five and twenty\r\n",
      "years of age. He had apparently been strangled, for there was no sign of\r\n",
      "any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me, but\r\n",
      "when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of\r\n",
      "my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled, and a\r\n",
      "mist came over my eyes, which obliged me to lean on a chair for\r\n",
      "support.  The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew\r\n",
      "an unfavourable augury from my manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The son confirmed his fatherâs account, but when Daniel Nugent was\r\n",
      "called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion, he\r\n",
      "saw a boat, with a single man in it, at a short distance from the shore;\r\n",
      "and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars, it was the same\r\n",
      "boat in which I had just landed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door\r\n",
      "of her cottage, waiting for the return of the fishermen, about an hour\r\n",
      "before she heard of the discovery of the body, when she saw a boat with\r\n",
      "only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse\r\n",
      "was afterwards found.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the\r\n",
      "body into her house; it was not cold.  They put it into a bed and\r\n",
      "rubbed it, and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary, but life was\r\n",
      "quite gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Several other men were examined concerning my landing, and they agreed\r\n",
      "that, with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night, it\r\n",
      "was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been\r\n",
      "obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.\r\n",
      "Besides, they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body\r\n",
      "from another place, and it was likely that as I did not appear to know\r\n",
      "the shore, I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance\r\n",
      "of the town of ââ from the place where I had deposited the corpse.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Kirwin, on hearing this evidence, desired that I should be taken into\r\n",
      "the room where the body lay for interment, that it might be observed what\r\n",
      "effect the sight of it would produce upon me. This idea was probably\r\n",
      "suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the\r\n",
      "murder had been described. I was accordingly conducted, by the magistrate\r\n",
      "and several other persons, to the inn. I could not help being struck by the\r\n",
      "strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but,\r\n",
      "knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had\r\n",
      "inhabited about the time that the body had been found, I was perfectly\r\n",
      "tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin. How\r\n",
      "can I describe my sensations on beholding it? I feel yet parched with\r\n",
      "horror, nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and\r\n",
      "agony. The examination, the presence of the magistrate and witnesses,\r\n",
      "passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry\r\n",
      "Clerval stretched before me. I gasped for breath, and throwing myself on\r\n",
      "the body, I exclaimed, âHave my murderous machinations deprived you\r\n",
      "also, my dearest Henry, of life? Two I have already destroyed; other\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured, and\r\n",
      "I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A fever succeeded to this. I lay for two months on the point of death; my\r\n",
      "ravings, as I afterwards heard, were frightful; I called myself the\r\n",
      "murderer of William, of Justine, and of Clerval. Sometimes I entreated my\r\n",
      "attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was\r\n",
      "tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping\r\n",
      "my neck, and screamed aloud with agony and terror. Fortunately, as I spoke\r\n",
      "my native language, Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and\r\n",
      "bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Why did I not die? More miserable than man ever was before, why did I not\r\n",
      "sink into forgetfulness and rest? Death snatches away many blooming\r\n",
      "children, the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and\r\n",
      "youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope, and the\r\n",
      "next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb! Of what materials was I\r\n",
      "made that I could thus resist so many shocks, which, like the turning of\r\n",
      "the wheel, continually renewed the torture?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from\r\n",
      "a dream, in a prison, stretched on a wretched bed, surrounded by\r\n",
      "gaolers, turnkeys, bolts, and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.\r\n",
      "It was morning, I remember, when I thus awoke to understanding; I had\r\n",
      "forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some\r\n",
      "great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around\r\n",

      "was, all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside\r\n",
      "me.  She was a hired nurse, the wife of one of the turnkeys, and her\r\n",
      "countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise\r\n",
      "that class.  The lines of her face were hard and rude, like that of\r\n",
      "persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery. Her\r\n",
      "tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English,\r\n",

      "still alive to feel this misery and horror.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âFor that matter,â replied the old woman, âif you mean about the\r\n",
      "gentleman you murdered, I believe that it were better for you if you\r\n",
      "were dead, for I fancy it will go hard with you!  However, thatâs none\r\n",

      "languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.  The whole series\r\n",
      "of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it\r\n",
      "were all true, for it never presented itself to my mind with the force\r\n",
      "of reality.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As the images that floated before me became more distinct, I grew\r\n",
      "feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed\r\n",
      "me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.  The\r\n",
      "physician came and prescribed medicines, and the old woman prepared\r\n",
      "them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first, and the\r\n",
      "expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the\r\n",
      "second.  Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the\r\n",
      "hangman who would gain his fee?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These were my first reflections, but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had\r\n",
      "shown me extreme kindness.  He had caused the best room in the prison\r\n",
      "to be prepared for me (wretched indeed was the best); and it was he who\r\n",
      "had provided a physician and a nurse.  It is true, he seldom came to\r\n",
      "see me, for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of\r\n",
      "every human creature, he did not wish to be present at the agonies and\r\n",
      "miserable ravings of a murderer.  He came, therefore, sometimes to see\r\n",
      "that I was not neglected, but his visits were short and with long\r\n",
      "intervals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One day, while I was gradually recovering, I was seated in a chair, my eyes\r\n",
      "half open and my cheeks livid like those in death. I was overcome by gloom\r\n",
      "and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to\r\n",
      "remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness. At one time I\r\n",
      "considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the\r\n",
      "penalty of the law, less innocent than poor Justine had been. Such were my\r\n",
      "thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.\r\n",
      "His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to\r\n",
      "mine and addressed me in French,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to\r\n",
      "make you more comfortable?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI thank you, but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole\r\n",
      "earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to\r\n",
      "one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.  But you will, I\r\n",
      "hope, soon quit this melancholy abode, for doubtless evidence can\r\n",
      "easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat is my least concern; I am, by a course of strange events, become\r\n",
      "the most miserable of mortals.  Persecuted and tortured as I am and\r\n",
      "have been, can death be any evil to me?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNothing indeed could be more unfortunate and agonising than the\r\n",
      "strange chances that have lately occurred.  You were thrown, by some\r\n",
      "surprising accident, on this shore, renowned for its hospitality,\r\n",
      "seized immediately, and charged with murder.  The first sight that was\r\n",
      "presented to your eyes was the body of your friend, murdered in so\r\n",
      "unaccountable a manner and placed, as it were, by some fiend across\r\n",
      "your path.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As Mr. Kirwin said this, notwithstanding the agitation I endured on\r\n",
      "this retrospect of my sufferings, I also felt considerable surprise at\r\n",
      "the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.  I suppose some\r\n",
      "astonishment was exhibited in my countenance, for Mr. Kirwin hastened\r\n",
      "to say,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âImmediately upon your being taken ill, all the papers that were on\r\n",
      "your person were brought me, and I examined them that I might discover some\r\n",
      "trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune\r\n",
      "and illness. I found several letters, and, among others, one which I\r\n",
      "discovered from its commencement to be from your father. I instantly wrote\r\n",
      "to Geneva; nearly two months have elapsed since the departure of my letter.\r\n",
      "But you are ill; even now you tremble; you are unfit for agitation of any\r\n",
      "kind.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThis suspense is a thousand times worse than the most horrible event;\r\n",
      "tell me what new scene of death has been acted, and whose murder I am\r\n",
      "now to lament?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYour family is perfectly well,â said Mr. Kirwin with\r\n",
      "gentleness; âand someone, a friend, is come to visit you.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself, but it\r\n",
      "instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my\r\n",
      "misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval, as a new incitement for\r\n",
      "me to comply with his hellish desires.  I put my hand before my eyes,\r\n",
      "and cried out in agony,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! Take him away! I cannot see him; for Godâs sake, do not\r\n",
      "let him enter!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.  He could not help\r\n",
      "regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in\r\n",
      "rather a severe tone,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI should have thought, young man, that the presence of your father\r\n",
      "would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMy father!â cried I, while every feature and every muscle was relaxed\r\n",
      "from anguish to pleasure.  âIs my father indeed come?  How kind, how\r\n",
      "very kind!  But where is he, why does he not hasten to me?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My change of manner surprised and pleased the magistrate; perhaps he\r\n",
      "thought that my former exclamation was a momentary return of delirium,\r\n",
      "and now he instantly resumed his former benevolence.  He rose and\r\n",
      "quitted the room with my nurse, and in a moment my father entered it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nothing, at this moment, could have given me greater pleasure than the\r\n",
      "arrival of my father. I stretched out my hand to him and cried,\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAre you then safeâand Elizabethâand Ernest?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My father calmed me with assurances of their welfare and endeavoured, by\r\n",
      "dwelling on these subjects so interesting to my heart, to raise my\r\n",
      "desponding spirits; but he soon felt that a prison cannot be the abode of\r\n",
      "cheerfulness. âWhat a place is this that you inhabit, my son!â\r\n",
      "said he, looking mournfully at the barred windows and wretched appearance\r\n",
      "of the room. âYou travelled to seek happiness, but a fatality seems\r\n",
      "to pursue you. And poor Clervalââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The name of my unfortunate and murdered friend was an agitation too\r\n",
      "great to be endured in my weak state; I shed tears.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAlas! Yes, my father,â replied I; âsome destiny of the\r\n",
      "most horrible kind hangs over me, and I must live to fulfil it, or surely I\r\n",
      "should have died on the coffin of Henry.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We were not allowed to converse for any length of time, for the\r\n",
      "precarious state of my health rendered every precaution necessary that\r\n",
      "could ensure tranquillity.  Mr. Kirwin came in and insisted that my\r\n",
      "strength should not be exhausted by too much exertion.  But the\r\n",
      "appearance of my father was to me like that of my good angel, and I\r\n",
      "gradually recovered my health.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As my sickness quitted me, I was absorbed by a gloomy and black\r\n",
      "melancholy that nothing could dissipate.  The image of Clerval was\r\n",
      "for ever before me, ghastly and murdered.  More than once the agitation\r\n",
      "into which these reflections threw me made my friends dread a dangerous\r\n",
      "relapse.  Alas!  Why did they preserve so miserable and detested a\r\n",
      "life?  It was surely that I might fulfil my destiny, which is now\r\n",
      "drawing to a close.  Soon, oh, very soon, will death extinguish these\r\n",
      "throbbings and relieve me from the mighty weight of anguish that bears\r\n",
      "me to the dust; and, in executing the award of justice, I shall also\r\n",
      "sink to rest.  Then the appearance of death was distant, although the\r\n",
      "wish was ever present to my thoughts; and I often sat for hours\r\n",
      "motionless and speechless, wishing for some mighty revolution that\r\n",
      "might bury me and my destroyer in its ruins.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The season of the assizes approached.  I had already been three months\r\n",
      "in prison, and although I was still weak and in continual danger of a\r\n",
      "relapse, I was obliged to travel nearly a hundred miles to the country\r\n",
      "town where the court was held.  Mr. Kirwin charged himself with every\r\n",
      "care of collecting witnesses and arranging my defence.  I was spared\r\n",
      "the disgrace of appearing publicly as a criminal, as the case was not\r\n",
      "brought before the court that decides on life and death.  The grand\r\n",
      "jury rejected the bill, on its being proved that I was on the Orkney\r\n",
      "Islands at the hour the body of my friend was found; and a fortnight\r\n",
      "after my removal I was liberated from prison.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My father was enraptured on finding me freed from the vexations of a\r\n",
      "criminal charge, that I was again allowed to breathe the fresh\r\n",
      "atmosphere and permitted to return to my native country.  I did not\r\n",
      "participate in these feelings, for to me the walls of a dungeon or a\r\n",
      "palace were alike hateful.  The cup of life was poisoned for ever, and\r\n",
      "although the sun shone upon me, as upon the happy and gay of heart, I\r\n",
      "saw around me nothing but a dense and frightful darkness, penetrated by\r\n",
      "no light but the glimmer of two eyes that glared upon me.  Sometimes\r\n",
      "they were the expressive eyes of Henry, languishing in death, the dark\r\n",
      "orbs nearly covered by the lids and the long black lashes that fringed\r\n",
      "them; sometimes it was the watery, clouded eyes of the monster, as I\r\n",
      "first saw them in my chamber at Ingolstadt.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My father tried to awaken in me the feelings of affection.  He talked\r\n",
      "of Geneva, which I should soon visit, of Elizabeth and Ernest; but\r\n",
      "these words only drew deep groans from me.  Sometimes, indeed, I felt a\r\n",
      "wish for happiness and thought with melancholy delight of my beloved\r\n",
      "cousin or longed, with a devouring _maladie du pays_, to see once more\r\n",
      "the blue lake and rapid Rhone, that had been so dear to me in early\r\n",
      "childhood; but my general state of feeling was a torpor in which a\r\n",
      "prison was as welcome a residence as the divinest scene in nature; and\r\n",
      "these fits were seldom interrupted but by paroxysms of anguish and\r\n",
      "despair.  At these moments I often endeavoured to put an end to the\r\n",
      "existence I loathed, and it required unceasing attendance and vigilance\r\n",
      "to restrain me from committing some dreadful act of violence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Yet one duty remained to me, the recollection of which finally\r\n",
      "triumphed over my selfish despair.  It was necessary that I should\r\n",
      "return without delay to Geneva, there to watch over the lives of those\r\n",
      "I so fondly loved and to lie in wait for the murderer, that if any\r\n",
      "chance led me to the place of his concealment, or if he dared again to\r\n",
      "blast me by his presence, I might, with unfailing aim, put an end to\r\n",
      "the existence of the monstrous image which  I had endued with the\r\n",
      "mockery of a soul still more monstrous.  My father still desired to\r\n",
      "delay our departure, fearful that I could not sustain the fatigues of a\r\n",
      "journey, for I was a shattered wreckâthe shadow of a human being.  My\r\n",
      "strength was gone.  I was a mere skeleton, and fever night and day\r\n",
      "preyed upon my wasted frame.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, as I urged our leaving Ireland with such inquietude and impatience,\r\n",
      "my father thought it best to yield. We took our passage on board a vessel\r\n",
      "bound for Havre-de-Grace and sailed with a fair wind from the Irish shores.\r\n",
      "It was midnight. I lay on the deck looking at the stars and listening to\r\n",
      "the dashing of the waves. I hailed the darkness that shut Ireland from my\r\n",
      "sight, and my pulse beat with a feverish joy when I reflected that I should\r\n",
      "soon see Geneva. The past appeared to me in the light of a frightful dream;\r\n",
      "yet the vessel in which I was, the wind that blew me from the detested\r\n",
      "shore of Ireland, and the sea which surrounded me, told me too forcibly\r\n",
      "that I was deceived by no vision and that Clerval, my friend and dearest\r\n",
      "companion, had fallen a victim to me and the monster of my creation. I\r\n",
      "repassed, in my memory, my whole life; my quiet happiness while residing\r\n",
      "with my family in Geneva, the death of my mother, and my departure for\r\n",
      "Ingolstadt. I remembered, shuddering, the mad enthusiasm that hurried me on\r\n",
      "to the creation of my hideous enemy, and I called to mind the night in\r\n",
      "which he first lived. I was unable to pursue the train of thought; a\r\n",
      "thousand feelings pressed upon me, and I wept bitterly.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ever since my recovery from the fever, I had been in the custom of taking\r\n",
      "every night a small quantity of laudanum, for it was by means of this drug\r\n",
      "only that I was enabled to gain the rest necessary for the preservation of\r\n",
      "life. Oppressed by the recollection of my various misfortunes, I now\r\n",
      "swallowed double my usual quantity and soon slept profoundly. But sleep did\r\n",
      "not afford me respite from thought and misery; my dreams presented a\r\n",
      "thousand objects that scared me. Towards morning I was possessed by a kind\r\n",
      "of nightmare; I felt the fiendâs grasp in my neck and could not free\r\n",
      "myself from it; groans and cries rang in my ears. My father, who was\r\n",
      "watching over me, perceiving my restlessness, awoke me; the dashing waves\r\n",
      "were around, the cloudy sky above, the fiend was not here: a sense of\r\n",
      "security, a feeling that a truce was established between the present hour\r\n",
      "and the irresistible, disastrous future imparted to me a kind of calm\r\n",

      "indefatigable, but he did not know the origin of my sufferings and\r\n",

      "decorations of my tragedy. Through my fatherâs exertions a part of\r\n",
      "the inheritance of Elizabeth had been restored to her by the Austrian\r\n",

      "was agreed that, immediately after our union, we should proceed to Villa\r\n",

      "near which it stood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the meantime I took every precaution to defend my person in case the\r\n",
      "fiend should openly attack me.  I carried pistols and a dagger\r\n",
      "constantly about me and was ever on the watch to prevent artifice, and\r\n",
      "by these means gained a greater degree of tranquillity.  Indeed, as the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Those were the last moments of my life during which I enjoyed the\r\n",
      "feeling of happiness.  We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot, but we\r\n",
      "were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the\r\n",
      "beauty of the scene, sometimes on one side of the lake, where we saw\r\n",
      "Mont SalÃªve, the pleasant banks of MontalÃ¨gre, and at a distance,\r\n",
      "surmounting all, the beautiful Mont Blanc, and the assemblage of snowy\r\n",

      "opposite banks, we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the\r\n",

      "painted in my face, my heart is contented.  Something whispers to me\r\n",
      "not to depend too much on the prospect that is opened before us, but I\r\n",
      "will not listen to such a sinister voice.  Observe how fast we move\r\n",
      "along and how the clouds, which sometimes obscure and sometimes rise\r\n",
      "above the dome of Mont Blanc, render this scene of beauty still more\r\n",

      "fiendish finger he pointed towards the corpse of my wife. I rushed towards\r\n",
      "the window, and drawing a pistol from my bosom, fired; but he eluded me,\r\n",
      "leaped from his station, and running with the swiftness of lightning,\r\n",
      "plunged into the lake.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The report of the pistol brought a crowd into the room. I pointed to\r\n",
      "the spot where he had disappeared, and we followed the track with\r\n",
      "boats; nets were cast, but in vain.  After passing several hours, we\r\n",
      "returned hopeless, most of my companions believing it to have been a\r\n",
      "form conjured up by my fancy.  After having landed, they proceeded to\r\n",
      "search the country, parties going in different directions among the\r\n",
      "woods and vines.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I attempted to accompany them and proceeded a short distance from the\r\n",
      "house, but my head whirled round, my steps were like those of a drunken\r\n",
      "man, I fell at last in a state of utter exhaustion; a film covered my\r\n",
      "eyes, and my skin was parched with the heat of fever.  In this state I\r\n",
      "was carried back and placed on a bed, hardly conscious of what had\r\n",
      "happened; my eyes wandered round the room as if to seek something that\r\n",
      "I had lost.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After an interval I arose, and as if by instinct, crawled into the room\r\n",
      "where the corpse of my beloved lay.  There were women weeping around; I\r\n",
      "hung over it and joined my sad tears to theirs; all this time no\r\n",
      "distinct idea presented itself to my mind, but my thoughts rambled to\r\n",
      "various subjects, reflecting confusedly on my misfortunes and their\r\n",
      "cause.  I was bewildered, in a cloud of wonder and horror.  The death\r\n",
      "of William, the execution of Justine, the murder of Clerval, and lastly\r\n",
      "of my wife; even at that moment I knew not that my only remaining\r\n",
      "friends were safe from the malignity of the fiend; my father even now\r\n",
      "might be writhing under his grasp, and Ernest might be dead at his\r\n",
      "feet.  This idea made me shudder and recalled me to action.  I started\r\n",
      "up and resolved to return to Geneva with all possible speed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There were no horses to be procured, and I must return by the lake; but the\r\n",
      "wind was unfavourable, and the rain fell in torrents. However, it was\r\n",
      "hardly morning, and I might reasonably hope to arrive by night. I hired men\r\n",
      "to row and took an oar myself, for I had always experienced relief from\r\n",
      "mental torment in bodily exercise. But the overflowing misery I now felt,\r\n",
      "and the excess of agitation that I endured rendered me incapable of any\r\n",
      "exertion. I threw down the oar, and leaning my head upon my hands, gave way\r\n",
      "to every gloomy idea that arose. If I looked up, I saw scenes which were\r\n",
      "familiar to me in my happier time and which I had contemplated but the day\r\n",
      "before in the company of her who was now but a shadow and a recollection.\r\n",
      "Tears streamed from my eyes. The rain had ceased for a moment, and I saw\r\n",
      "the fish play in the waters as they had done a few hours before; they had\r\n",
      "then been observed by Elizabeth. Nothing is so painful to the human mind as\r\n",
      "a great and sudden change. The sun might shine or the clouds might lower,\r\n",
      "but nothing could appear to me as it had done the day before. A fiend had\r\n",
      "snatched from me every hope of future happiness; no creature had ever been\r\n",
      "so miserable as I was; so frightful an event is single in the history of\r\n",
      "man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But why should I dwell upon the incidents that followed this last\r\n",
      "overwhelming event? Mine has been a tale of horrors; I have reached their\r\n",
      "_acme_, and what I must now relate can but be tedious to you. Know\r\n",
      "that, one by one, my friends were snatched away; I was left desolate. My\r\n",
      "own strength is exhausted, and I must tell, in a few words, what remains of\r\n",
      "my hideous narration.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I arrived at Geneva. My father and Ernest yet lived, but the former sunk\r\n",
      "under the tidings that I bore. I see him now, excellent and venerable old\r\n",
      "man! His eyes wandered in vacancy, for they had lost their charm and their\r\n",
      "delightâhis Elizabeth, his more than daughter, whom he doted on with\r\n",
      "all that affection which a man feels, who in the decline of life, having\r\n",
      "few affections, clings more earnestly to those that remain. Cursed, cursed\r\n",
      "be the fiend that brought misery on his grey hairs and doomed him to waste\r\n",
      "in wretchedness! He could not live under the horrors that were accumulated\r\n",
      "around him; the springs of existence suddenly gave way; he was unable to\r\n",
      "rise from his bed, and in a few days he died in my arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "What then became of me?  I know not; I lost sensation, and chains and\r\n",
      "darkness were the only objects that pressed upon me.  Sometimes,\r\n",
      "indeed, I dreamt that I wandered in flowery meadows and pleasant vales\r\n",
      "with the friends of my youth, but I awoke and found myself in a\r\n",
      "dungeon.  Melancholy followed, but by degrees I gained a clear\r\n",
      "conception of my miseries and situation and was then released from my\r\n",
      "prison.  For they had called me mad, and during many months, as I\r\n",
      "understood, a solitary cell had been my habitation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Liberty, however, had been a useless gift to me, had I not, as I\r\n",
      "awakened to reason, at the same time awakened to revenge.  As the\r\n",
      "memory of past misfortunes pressed upon me, I began to reflect on their\r\n",
      "causeâthe monster whom I had created, the miserable dÃ¦mon whom I had\r\n",
      "sent abroad into the world for my destruction.  I was possessed by a\r\n",
      "maddening rage when I thought of him, and desired and ardently prayed\r\n",
      "that I might have him within my grasp to wreak a great and signal\r\n",
      "revenge on his cursed head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nor did my hate long confine itself to useless wishes; I began to\r\n",
      "reflect on the best means of securing him; and for this purpose, about\r\n",
      "a month after my release, I repaired to a criminal judge in the town\r\n",
      "and told him that I had an accusation to make, that I knew the\r\n",
      "destroyer of my family, and that I required him to exert his whole\r\n",
      "authority for the apprehension of the murderer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The magistrate listened to me with attention and kindness. âBe\r\n",
      "assured, sir,â said he, âno pains or exertions on my part shall\r\n",
      "be spared to discover the villain.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI thank you,â replied I; âlisten, therefore, to the\r\n",
      "deposition that I have to make. It is indeed a tale so strange that I\r\n",
      "should fear you would not credit it were there not something in truth\r\n",
      "which, however wonderful, forces conviction. The story is too connected to\r\n",
      "be mistaken for a dream, and I have no motive for falsehood.â My\r\n",
      "manner as I thus addressed him was impressive but calm; I had formed in my\r\n",
      "own heart a resolution to pursue my destroyer to death, and this purpose\r\n",
      "quieted my agony and for an interval reconciled me to life. I now related\r\n",
      "my history briefly but with firmness and precision, marking the dates with\r\n",
      "accuracy and never deviating into invective or exclamation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The magistrate appeared at first perfectly incredulous, but as I continued\r\n",
      "he became more attentive and interested; I saw him sometimes shudder with\r\n",
      "horror; at others a lively surprise, unmingled with disbelief, was painted\r\n",
      "on his countenance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "whole power. It is your duty as a magistrate, and I believe and hope that\r\n",

      "auditor. He had heard my story with that half kind of belief that is given\r\n",
      "to a tale of spirits and supernatural events; but when he was called upon\r\n",
      "to act officially in consequence, the whole tide of his incredulity\r\n",
      "returned. He, however, answered mildly, âI would willingly afford you\r\n",
      "every aid in your pursuit, but the creature of whom you speak appears to\r\n",
      "have powers which would put all my exertions to defiance. Who can follow an\r\n",
      "animal which can traverse the sea of ice and inhabit caves and dens where\r\n",
      "no man would venture to intrude? Besides, some months have elapsed since\r\n",

      "âI do not doubt that he hovers near the spot which I inhabit, and if\r\n",
      "he has indeed taken refuge in the Alps, he may be hunted like the chamois\r\n",
      "and destroyed as a beast of prey. But I perceive your thoughts; you do not\r\n",
      "credit my narrative and do not intend to pursue my enemy with the\r\n",
      "punishment which is his desert.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As I spoke, rage sparkled in my eyes; the magistrate was intimidated.\r\n",
      "âYou are mistaken,â said he. âI will exert myself, and if\r\n",
      "it is in my power to seize the monster, be assured that he shall suffer\r\n",
      "punishment proportionate to his crimes. But I fear, from what you have\r\n",
      "yourself described to be his properties, that this will prove\r\n",
      "impracticable; and thus, while every proper measure is pursued, you should\r\n",
      "make up your mind to disappointment.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat cannot be; but all that I can say will be of little avail.  My\r\n",
      "revenge is of no moment to you; yet, while I allow it to be a vice, I\r\n",
      "confess that it is the devouring and only passion of my soul.  My rage\r\n",
      "is unspeakable when I reflect that the murderer, whom I have turned\r\n",
      "loose upon society, still exists.  You refuse my just demand; I have\r\n",

      "entrance of the cemetery where William, Elizabeth, and my father\r\n",
      "reposed.  I entered it and approached the tomb which marked their\r\n",
      "graves.  Everything was silent except the leaves of the trees, which\r\n",
      "were gently agitated by the wind; the night was nearly dark, and the\r\n",
      "scene would have been solemn and affecting even to an uninterested\r\n",
      "observer.  The spirits of the departed seemed to flit around and to\r\n",

      "mourner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "the furies possessed me as I concluded, and rage choked my utterance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I pursued him, and for many months this has been my task.  Guided by a\r\n",

      "took my passage in the same ship, but he escaped, I know not how.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Amidst the wilds of Tartary and Russia, although he still evaded me, I\r\n",

      "who feared that if I lost all trace of him I should despair and die,\r\n",
      "left some mark to guide me.  The snows descended on my head, and I saw\r\n",
      "the print of his huge step on the white plain.  To you first entering\r\n",
      "on life, to whom care is new and agony unknown, how can you understand\r\n",
      "what I have felt and still feel?  Cold, want, and fatigue were the\r\n",
      "least pains which I was destined to endure; I was cursed by some devil\r\n",

      "followed and directed my steps and when I most murmured would suddenly\r\n",
      "extricate me from seemingly insurmountable difficulties.  Sometimes,\r\n",
      "when nature, overcome by hunger, sank under the exhaustion, a repast\r\n",
      "was prepared for me in the desert that restored and inspirited me.  The\r\n",
      "fare was, indeed, coarse, such as the peasants of the country ate, but\r\n",
      "I will not doubt that it was set there by the spirits that I had\r\n",
      "invoked to aid me.  Often, when all was dry, the heavens cloudless, and\r\n",
      "I was parched by thirst, a slight cloud would bedim the sky, shed the\r\n",
      "few drops that revived me, and vanish.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I followed, when I could, the courses of the rivers; but the dÃ¦mon\r\n",
      "generally avoided these, as it was here that the population of the\r\n",
      "country chiefly collected.  In other places human beings were seldom\r\n",
      "seen, and I generally subsisted on the wild animals that crossed my\r\n",
      "path.  I had money with me and gained the friendship of the villagers\r\n",
      "by distributing it; or I brought with me some food that I had killed,\r\n",
      "which, after taking a small part, I always presented to those who had\r\n",
      "provided me with fire and utensils for cooking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My life, as it passed thus, was indeed hateful to me, and it was during\r\n",
      "sleep alone that I could taste joy. O blessed sleep! Often, when most\r\n",
      "miserable, I sank to repose, and my dreams lulled me even to rapture. The\r\n",
      "spirits that guarded me had provided these moments, or rather hours, of\r\n",
      "happiness that I might retain strength to fulfil my pilgrimage. Deprived of\r\n",
      "this respite, I should have sunk under my hardships. During the day I was\r\n",
      "sustained and inspirited by the hope of night, for in sleep I saw my\r\n",
      "friends, my wife, and my beloved country; again I saw the benevolent\r\n",
      "countenance of my father, heard the silver tones of my Elizabethâs\r\n",
      "voice, and beheld Clerval enjoying health and youth. Often, when wearied by\r\n",
      "a toilsome march, I persuaded myself that I was dreaming until night should\r\n",
      "come and that I should then enjoy reality in the arms of my dearest\r\n",
      "friends. What agonising fondness did I feel for them! How did I cling to\r\n",
      "their dear forms, as sometimes they haunted even my waking hours, and\r\n",
      "persuade myself that they still lived! At such moments vengeance, that\r\n",
      "burned within me, died in my heart, and I pursued my path towards the\r\n",
      "destruction of the dÃ¦mon more as a task enjoined by heaven, as the\r\n",

      "ever done before. A ground sea was heard; the thunder of its progress, as\r\n",
      "the waters rolled and swelled beneath me, became every moment more ominous\r\n",
      "and terrific. I pressed on, but in vain. The wind arose; the sea roared;\r\n",
